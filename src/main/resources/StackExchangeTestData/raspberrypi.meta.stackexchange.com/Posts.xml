If there are a range of good tools that run well, then this shows that it is a task that can be sensibly accomplished.

Not &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/faq&quot;&gt;programmers&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://superuser.com/faq&quot;&gt;computer enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt;, not &lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;*nix users&lt;/a&gt;, and not &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronics.stackexchange.com/faq&quot;&gt;electrical engineers&lt;/a&gt;... Although you personally may fit into one or more of these groups, and this site should certainly draw on the expertise found elsewhere when possible, the purpose of creating RaspberryPi.SE isn't to fill in some gap left by the intersection of others; rather it is to carve out &lt;em&gt;its own&lt;/em&gt; scope, one fitting the needs of &lt;em&gt;its own&lt;/em&gt; audience. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that happens to include a bunch of topics that aren't &lt;em&gt;strictly unique&lt;/em&gt; to the Pi, then so be it. The task at hand is to &lt;em&gt;define&lt;/em&gt; the scope, not preemptively prune it back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Wiki references&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the meat of your proposal here. I very much like the direction you're taking with &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/387/how-do-i-install-new-software&quot;&gt;How do I install new software?&lt;/a&gt; - this is a great example of a question that &lt;em&gt;isn't at all specific to RaspberryPi&lt;/em&gt; but will likely be shared by quite a few beginners. Rather than turning them away, or duplicating in-depth documentation for the various package managers, this wiki takes a pragmatic approach: a short reference, obviously intended for beginners, with links to more detailed information elsewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal here is collaboration - which is also &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/08/the-future-of-community-wiki/&quot;&gt;the reason for the continued existence of the Community Wiki feature&lt;/a&gt;. Rather than looking at them as &quot;protected&quot; exceptions to some normally-enforced rule, view them as proactive measures to address beginner questions that might otherwise prove to be a distraction. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What becomes canon?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The last piece of this puzzle is the question of &lt;em&gt;which topics&lt;/em&gt; deserve this treatment. In general, these should emerge organically: if you're seeing new users repeatedly asking very similar questions, taking the time to write a comprehensive answer can go a long way toward easing the burden. You can &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/01/the-wikipedia-of-long-tail-programming-questions/&quot;&gt;edit the question to generalize it&lt;/a&gt; to a degree, but other than that these shouldn't &lt;em&gt;normally&lt;/em&gt; need any special treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the goal is &lt;em&gt;specifically&lt;/em&gt; (as with Andrew's question) to construct a collaboratively-written reference for some topic, then you can signal this with a &quot;community wiki&quot; post. Note that there's rarely a need for making the &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; community-wiki (which requires moderator intervention anyway) - anyone can post a CW &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; if their goal is to explicitly invite others to jump in and contribute. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One final note on CW: avoid creating &quot;stubs&quot; that you expect someone else to fill in - these are just noise. And if you're not starting with an &lt;em&gt;actual answer to an actual question&lt;/em&gt;, then you probably need to stop and ask yourself if this is something anyone &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; needs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In closing: don't get too distracted by FAQs and references&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm glad to see that you're all thinking about this stuff already, but don't spend &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; much time on it up front.

I've followed the site from definition phase into the beta, and have a general idea of the direction the community is headed.  I've earned the Convention badge, a requirement of moderation on Stack Overflow, and began a lot of the initial necessary discussion for a successful beta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to participation in the site, I'm also highly interested in outreach.  This may not, strictly speaking, be the responsibility of moderators, though speaking from an official capacity may give outreach some more weight.  I think as the site grows and gains popularity it will be important to directly contact the foundation and open a one-on-one dialog with their PR representative to discuss any possibility of their support or participation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Why you should vote for me&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Upon appointment as a moderator I would immediately set aside my own personal convictions for the direction of the site in favor of representing the community as a whole.  Thus far a lot of my input has been discussion and disagreement with other beta users.  While the discussion could continue, &lt;strong&gt;my intervention and actions themselves, as well as the reasoning and explanation for these actions, would be as a representative of the community at-large&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In representing the community, I would provide guidance with &lt;strong&gt;respect and fairness.&lt;/strong&gt;  If an action is representative of the site's community I would not hesitate to do it, but would always couple this firmness with respect.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I would be careful to make sure I comment, in detail, on posts that I either take an action on or consider taking an action on.  Since my participation in the Stack Exchange community as a whole, I have paid close attention to Robert Cartaino's example in doing this and would follow it carefully.  The difference between a frustrating experience and an understanding one for a user can be as simple as &lt;strong&gt;polite, prompt communication&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Though I do not post answers, questions or comments every day, I make sure to visit the site at least once but usually &lt;strong&gt;multiple times daily&lt;/strong&gt; to see if I can contribute.

It's becoming apparent that not all Unix questions are off-topic and it is difficult to find a clear cut-off point. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's take a few example questions.

Currently we can split up the tag into two separate categories.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about configuring operating systems, and&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Questions about configuring software.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Right now I feel that when referring to the second context this tag does not provide much taxonomic value. There is no fundamental difference when answering a question about configuring software rather than fixing an error.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That leaves a tag for operating system configuration.

In fact, the only ones I could find that were relevant are the following two.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/1118/46&quot;&gt;How would I write a one-off boot script?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/1132/46&quot;&gt;Which locale should I select during the Raspbian setup?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what am I proposing?

When can’t I use the Raspberry Pi Marks?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You may not:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(i)           use the Raspberry Pi Marks as part of your company name, company logo or product name;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is already dealt with as we are seeking a logo of our own.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(ii)         use the Raspberry Pi Word Mark as part of the domain name for your website;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the moment we &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; fall foul of this. Whether we do or don't depends on how the &quot;part of a domain name&quot; should be interpreted. If it is interpreted as &quot;substring of the main domain name&quot; we would be fine, as &lt;code&gt;raspberrypi&lt;/code&gt; is only in the subdomain. If it is interpreted as &quot;any part of a domain name&quot; then we could have a problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would argue that the latter would be considered excessive by many, but by flouting it, we could annoy the Foundation members who already have negative feelings about Raspberry Pi Stack Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having said that, if in the three years since we went live, this issue has not been raised by the Raspberry Pi foundation, then the former interpretation is more likely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Incidentally, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordmark&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Wordmark&lt;/a&gt; appears to have a specific legal meaning which appears inappropriate to this context, so it would be difficult to know how enforceable this would be without legal advice.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(iii)        use the Raspberry Pi Marks in a way that creates a false impression that your product or business endorsed, sponsored or associated with Raspberry Pi or Raspberry Pi products or services;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that we need to make it clear that we are (as yet) in no way associated with the Foundation. This could go in the site header, the FAQ or (preferably) both.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also my feeling that this site is obviously part of the stack exchange network, with distinctly different branding which would be difficult to mistake for official Raspberry Pi Foundation branding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(viii)     use a name or logo which are so similar to the Raspberry Pi Marks which may confuse or mislead people into thinking that your business, products or services originate from or are associated with Raspberry Pi;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, I think we have already considered this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(ix)        use the Raspberry Pi Marks or a name or logo which is similar to them in a way that will take advantage of our brand or our reputation;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We may think that RP.SE is doing the Raspberry Pi community a service, but some people have already suggested that we are some fly by night trying to take advantage of the popularity of the Raspberry Pi.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;(xi)        try to pass-off your business, products or services as associated with Raspberry Pi and/or damage our goodwill in any way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;as (iii).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;em&gt;Trademark Rules&lt;/em&gt; page was updated to mention domain names some time between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20120412004256/http://www.raspberrypi.org/trademark-rules&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;12th April 2012&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://web.archive.org/web/20120503095858/http://www.raspberrypi.org/trademark-rules&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;3rd May 2012&lt;/a&gt; (probably on the latter date) while &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/37041/raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;RP.SE site&lt;/a&gt; went public on 19th June 2012, after entering commitment on the 19th April. Thus it is likely that stack exchange had already decided on the subdomain name for the site before the Foundation announced it's change of policy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we want the Foundation to get on board, perhaps we need to consider being more considerate of their &lt;em&gt;rules&lt;/em&gt;.

Users who would have otherwise used OSX or Windows 7 are now having to learn about the many oddities inherent to Linux: terminal commands and an eerily familiar GUI interface (at least with &quot;Wheezy&quot;). In addition, the Pi doesn't even come with a preinstalled OS - something that surprised myself and surely many others. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With so many new options and ideas flying at us (the n00b users - a.k.a myself) I thought that it would be helpful to implement an area where people new to the site can begin to get an understanding of the Pi - and of the Stack Exchange community as a whole. There are other reasons to create an FAQ - as mentioned in &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/297/6609&quot;&gt;this meta post&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Only around 6% of our total user base are staying around to gather over 200 reputation&quot; and &quot;on average we're only getting 3 new questions each day. This needs to be 5 times higher for us to stand a chance of graduating.&quot; These, are serious issues, which I believe help to warrant the need for an FAQ. If new users don't understand how to ask good questions - they are likely to be down voted - and this drives them away from our community. But, if they first find an answer through an FAQ - where the questions are presumably rather good, they will be able to follow the lead and ask appropriately. Secondly, I have found in school that once I have a greater understanding of a subject, I will ask more questions in return. An FAQ solves both of these issues and also puts less of a strain on the community to answer questions which may have been easier to solve through a central hub.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am going to be honest about this - I am not sure &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; how this is going to work. I believe that we should copy from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/7931/210573&quot;&gt;Meta Stack Overflow FAQ.&lt;/a&gt; I failed in doing this due to my zeal, but an FAQ should &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; be collaboratively edited - this ensures that such an important post will not be the creation of one person. To me, that FAQ also proves that it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to have an FAQ in &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/ask&quot;&gt;the question form&lt;/a&gt;... &lt;em&gt;except&lt;/em&gt; that it isn't one. I also think that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq-proposed&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;faq-proposed&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;faq-proposed&lt;/a&gt; tag is a brilliant idea - it helps moderators and the user base as a whole identify potential candidates for the FAQ. Lastly, questions that are part of the FAQ should have a link that links back to the FAQ - this will make it easier for users to navigate the post.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite my overall concurrence, I still have a few gripes about their method. Firstly, the people whom asked the questions should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; have to convert them to community wiki - good questions should be &lt;em&gt;rewarded, not taken away.&lt;/em&gt; Lastly, we should ensure that there is a high section to question ratio - otherwise the FAQ will become overly confusing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Why not tag-wiki's&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that tag wiki's are automatic, they can at times be rather overcrowded. As this site gets bigger (the Pi is gaining in popularity - I believe that we will pass beta eventually) tags will become more crowded and confusing. Yes, there will be several comprehensive, easy to use ones (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/config.txt&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;config.txt&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;config.txt&lt;/a&gt; as Jivings mentioned. But, the vast majority will be confusing and impossible to use. To prove this, go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; and search for &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python?sort=frequent&amp;amp;pagesize=50&quot;&gt;Python.&lt;/a&gt; I truly doubt that that will help anyone. In addition, searching up questions in the search bar is hardly ever helpful - you are usually greeted by a bunch of unhelpful, badly made questions. This is why a community moderated FAQ is better - it creates a central hub for common questions. Also, remember that the FAQ is meant to be used by &lt;em&gt;novice&lt;/em&gt; users of the Pi - it is unlikely that they will be able to navigate this site effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Summary&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will be easier for new users to get used to the proper Stack Exchange format&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Avid&quot; users will not be burdened with easy to solve questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because they will know the proper format, new users won't leave - and might get over 200 rep, bringing us closer to graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will become easier to find on search engines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implementation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should use question format&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaboratively Edited&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions in FAQ should &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be community wiki questions - reward helpful questions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher section-to-question ratio; don't become confusing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;On FAQ questions, there should be links to the actual FAQ&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why not tag-wiki's&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overcrowded&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Confusing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novice user's might not realize this functionality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will edit this as my views evolve, but I hope that this conveys my current views effectively.

I believe that we should copy from the Meta Stack&#xA;  Overflow FAQ.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is a Meta question, about Meta questions. Which is why it's okay, and why there exists an &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/faq&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;faq&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;faq&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;code&gt;meta.raspberrypi&lt;/code&gt;. Meta is for questions &lt;em&gt;about the site&lt;/em&gt;. I would say that Questions or Answers that are just internal links are &lt;em&gt;about the site&lt;/em&gt; and should not exist in main.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main site is not a place for creating questions that add no content but link to other questions. The reasons behind this are twofold;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It creates precedent for list based questions and answer, making them more likely to reoccur. This flies in the face of what I consider to be two of the Stack Exchange core principles; questions should be specific, and answers should be able to stand alone.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is too difficult to pose an FAQ as a question, because it isn't one. We can't start breaking the rules that govern the Stack Exchange format. It looks bad and will add an air of confusion to new users.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;So what is the solution?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Tag-wikis. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A tag is a keyword or label that categorizes your question with other, similar questions. Using the right tags makes it easier for others to find and answer your question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is exactly what the purpose of an FAQ would be. There are some extremely compreshensive tag wiki pages (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/config.txt&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;config.txt&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;config.txt&lt;/a&gt;), demonstrating their effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, consider that tags should be resilient. There should be questions that require them, and we shouldn't create tags for our own purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am by no means saying that tag-wikis are the only solution. I just can't think of a better one that doesn't compromise the site integrity.

Should it really be a FAQ? If so - it's enough to sort questions by upvotes which I believe is the best estimation of how frequent the question would be asked.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What @xxmbabanexx did is a little different, however. First of all he took some questions he though are important for new users. Then he categorized them a little.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I believe it's all about gathering some questions that all not experienced users could find in one place, structured in some way comfortable for them (i.e. they will find the answers they probably need even when they don't yet know about that).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Single &lt;code&gt;FAQ&lt;/code&gt; tag unfortunately can't achieve that. Creating multiple &lt;code&gt;FAQ&lt;/code&gt; tags can make a burden. Using tag-wikis and &lt;code&gt;faq-proposed&lt;/code&gt; temporary tag (which would then could be removed when some user with enough reputation edits the wiki-tag) could do the trick. But I think it would be the best if TOC of the FAQ could be in the tag-wiki's excerpt so that it's immediately visible for the users. I'm not sure if that's possible, thought. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1070" LastActivityDate="2013-03-30T10:12:40.477" CommentCount="2" />

But its usage is not limited as in the case of an embedded system. RPi is being used in many interesting applications like a media center, a web server; it has even been integrated into a boat to perform circumnavigation. Using RPi for these applications require the user to be knowledgeable not only in Embedded Programming &amp;amp; Design but also in many other things like how to setup a network, managing applications, etc. Merging RPi with Embedded Programming &amp;amp; Design proposal will deprive the users of RPi of those kind of information. After all, one cannot forget that RPi was originally designed to encourage students to learn computer programming.

Even if there were existing answers, I had to top it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing wrong with that if you actually have an answer you think is reasonable and make a decent effort to communicate it.  Except if you are skipping meals and bathing, lol -- OCD is bad.  But more for you than the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This left little to no room for other users to give an answer and, in my mind, was hurting the progress of this website graduating.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That doesn't make much sense; if someone else has an answer they don't see, they'll post it.  A dozen half-assed or incorrect answers has never stopped me from adding a better one ;)  Part of what's good about the &quot;gamification&quot; of voting is that answers are ranked, and then of course, we have moderators etc. to clean up and delete garbage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not looking at the site evaluation right now, but I don't think having a high &quot;answer to question&quot; ratio is part of it, so this can't hurt our chances of graduation (I believe it's the other way around: a high ration &lt;em&gt;is good&lt;/em&gt;).  The &lt;em&gt;quality&lt;/em&gt; of answers is of course relevant, but quantity doesn't automatically exclude that.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, again, if you don't think you have a particularly good answer and there are already better ones, don't bother.  If there's some bit of info you think is missing, &lt;strong&gt;use a comment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do see a lot of rapid fire rep whoring on the original S.E. site (Stack Overflow) now, to negative effect, but that is because of the huge volume.  I don't think it's a significant problem here at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I have now started to ask more questions instead&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having good questions is probably even more important than having good answers, since one tends to lead to the other.  Like S.O. and &lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;U&amp;amp;L&lt;/a&gt; we get a lot of questions that are not exactly duplicates, but are not exactly original either; these are written by people who I think are not at all aware of the Stack Exchange paradigm (canonical questions with canonical answers) and treat their question as something casual and disposable, rather than thinking about stuff like:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I focus on the real issue and set aside irrelevant details?&lt;/em&gt;  Realistically, if this were done more we'd have less questions (which might not be so bad, because maybe the others would get answered better), since for a very high percentage of them, the fact that a raspberry pi is involved is irrelevant -- general linux questions belong somewhere else.  OTOH, there are linuxy things that suit this site because they involve things someone might do with a pi in particular.  So a gray area, but something to keep in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;How can I ask a question so that other people find it useful?&lt;/em&gt;  This is really the same point again: we want specific questions on specific issues, not rambling stories.  This means, eg., that if your &quot;question&quot; is really a set of things related by circumstances (namely, yours), then you should consider whether it might be better broken into separate, specific questions.  &lt;strong&gt;You want to avoid the particular in favour of the general in so far as you can.&lt;/strong&gt;  I know it is tempting to explain &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; you stumbled across a problem, but it probably doesn't matter, and will easily draw you away from the general into the particular.  Just leave that stuff out and ask a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Thinking along these lines, coming up with questions that you know the answer to (and then providing that) is a great thing to do for a few reasons: You can target issues you find in some of the rambling particular questions in a way that makes your answer more widely applicable, and it (ideally) creates more canonical questions with canonical answers.  Remember to tick them, of course, because the &lt;em&gt;checked answers : questions&lt;/em&gt; ratio is important to our graduation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just to make that last point clear in case you were unaware: &lt;strong&gt;intentionally asking questions you provide the answer to is encouraged&lt;/strong&gt;, presuming they are new and useful.  Then you can give yourself 15 points and feel good about it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:37:12.973" LastActivityDate="2013-12-31T12:51:11.787" CommentCount="0" />

That may seem a bit zealous, but I think some of my points here are worth considering -- if we closed more low quality questions, we would improve the general quality of things on the site, and get rid of potential tumbleweed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This doesn't have to apply to just recent questions, obviously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12713/setting-up-raspberry-pi-so-as-to-connect-to-a-server&quot;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12713/setting-up-raspberry-pi-so-as-to-connect-to-a-server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I voted to close this because it is &lt;em&gt;too broad&lt;/em&gt;.  Asking &quot;how to stream data from a computer&quot;, or &quot;how to store information in a database&quot; without more specifics shows a complete lack of effort in prior research; while someone &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; answer the question by regurgitating some basic material easily found in wikipedia, I'm sure that neither of these topics needs yet another internet posting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Poorly researched&quot; is the #1 tooltip for downvoting questions, but in terms of getting the point across, closing it is probably more effective -- remember, the OP will automatically get the attention of a moderator if s/he then chooses to edit and improve the question. Downvoters may never bother to return and change their minds even if the question is improved and corrected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if you see stuff like this, &lt;strong&gt;vote to close&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12712/1-motor-spradically-stops-when-going-forward&quot;&gt;1 motor spradically stops when going forward&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seems valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12711/pwm-not-found-in-occidentalis-v0-2&quot;&gt;PWM not found in Occidentalis v0.2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Seems valid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12709/raspcontrol-help&quot;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12709/raspcontrol-help&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I voted to close this question as &lt;em&gt;unclear&lt;/em&gt;.  While superficially it &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; clear, if one considers the steps involved in the problem -- significantly, installation of a web server, which is not even identified -- then it starts to seem more like something very lazy.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Considering I did not make a comment (&quot;We need more information&quot;), that may seem a little unfair.  However, my word is not the last word, either, so by the time we get to the 5 close votes, some of that &quot;unfairness&quot; will likely be resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mention that because I think that if you believe something should be closed, then you should &lt;strong&gt;vote to close&lt;/strong&gt; even if you don't have time to make a comment, or anything in particular to say beyond having chosen a reason.  This is significantly different than downvoting with no explanation, esp. since a close can be completely reversed by the community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12708/forward-audio-from-usb-input-to-jack-output&quot;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12708/forward-audio-from-usb-input-to-jack-output&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ditto the last question -- I voted to close as &quot;unclear&quot; with no further explanation because the OP was to lazy to even explain what s/he means by &quot;USB input&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, someone could prompt the OP for more info, which is fine; I do that sometimes.  However, I do think it encourages an environment whereby people think it is okay to be say as little as possible because &quot;if more information is needed someone can ask for it&quot;.  Closing a question makes it clear that's &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the ideal attitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12705/problem-installing-ruby-on-rails-server-on-raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;Problem installing Ruby on Rails server on Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I voted to close this as &quot;unclear&quot; too.  The question &lt;em&gt;seems&lt;/em&gt; to be centered on the idea that some Ruby component may have a minimum RAM requirement, but rather than researching that or asking the question somewhere more appropriate (e.g., a Ruby forum), the OP simply decides to ask &quot;Has anyone got this working on a Model B?&quot;  If we say that is okay, watch the quality of the questions go out the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12701/trouble-connecting-to-wireless-network-two-rooms-away&quot;&gt;Trouble connecting to wireless network two rooms away&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I voted to close this as &quot;too broad&quot; because it is.

It is not a great answer, but one of the points I make is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If [...] you want a more detailed answer to the question, &lt;em&gt;How do I select the active video output?&lt;/em&gt; then ask that as a separate question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I often think about doing this, and I'm going to start more often.  The other option is the question becomes completely localized, because what should have been something general (and more widely useful) gets answered in a Q&amp;amp;A in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12698/cec-on-sharp-tv-remote-xml-fails-after-tv-power-off&quot;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12698/cec-on-sharp-tv-remote-xml-fails-after-tv-power-off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I voted to close this as &quot;unclear&quot;.  The effort is so low here the OP never actually asks a question.  S/he just sort of implies one, kinda.  I guess.  Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12690/unable-to-see-webpage-for-webcam-stream-update-can-now-see-stream-in-vlc-but-s&quot;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12690/unable-to-see-webpage-for-webcam-stream-update-can-now-see-stream-in-vlc-but-s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I voted to close this one as &quot;unclear&quot; although &quot;too broad&quot; would also fit.

The topic of the question is heavily programming related (in Java). The library I'm using is not Raspberry-specific; its a general audio library included in the Java JDK. Despite that, it is relevant in the context of the Pi because it relates to an issue I have thus far &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; observed on the PI. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I was unsure from the beginning whether my question was more appropriate on Stackoverflow, or to post it here. I checked out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic&quot;&gt;on-topic&lt;/a&gt; help page, and thought that the question was appropriate because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It satisfied the on-topic requirement: &lt;em&gt;Software that runs on the Raspberry Pi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;And did not satisfy the off-topic requirement: &lt;em&gt;Questions about programming that are not related to its usage on the Raspberry Pi. These will probably be better off on Programmers or Stackoverflow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I notice it is not receiving a lot of views, which has me wondering more so whether this was the appropriate place.

Ultimately, since I will be doing a ton of programming on the Raspberry for the next little while, I might be posting again, so I want to see whether such questions are better served here, or on Stackoverflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, is my question relevant to the Raspberry PI SE site?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;P.S: Not to worry, I'm not feeling impatient, I basically want to know where questions like this are better served&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; It seems &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/14387/13332&quot;&gt;this person&lt;/a&gt; is wondering the same thing in regards to their question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="13332" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:27.120" LastActivityDate="2014-03-14T22:41:32.507" Title="Programming question in context of Raspberry PI - Does it belong here?"

Full fledged regular Stack Exchange sites get to hold elections, but we have to make it out of beta first!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Making it out of beta means improving &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/37041/raspberry-pi&quot;&gt;our stats&lt;/a&gt;.  Doing this isn't just about trying to work numbers so we can have a fancier banner, a real logo, hold elections, etc.  It should also help to improve the general tenor of the place, inspire greater confidence in users, save time navigating around when looking for an answer, and so on. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are not doing all that bad to start with. The two most obvious problems:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Not enough questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Too many questions without accepted or upvoted answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second one is more serious, since that's the one that explicitly &quot;Needs Work&quot;.  However, it bears a bit of a relationship to the first one, which is just barely &quot;Okay&quot;.  Some questions don't have good answers simply because they are bad questions; these can be closed, but this lowers our question count at the same time as it improves our answered ratio.  Of course, that doesn't mean we should leave bad questions; there's no value in cruft.  It means we need to ask more good ones.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Writing Self-answered Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing some users may be unaware of is that &lt;strong&gt;you can ask and answer your own question all at once&lt;/strong&gt; to describe a solution to a problem you think others will find useful; there's even a check box to do this directly at the bottom of the &quot;Ask Questions&quot; form. This is encouraged and should not be seen as self aggrandizement; decent, complete Q&amp;amp;A's help the site as a whole.  Self answered questions actually tend to be of higher quality than those written by someone that did not already know the answer, because the questioner is less likely to be confused by irrelevant details.  This makes it more useful to people looking for an answer since the question is, ideally, a clarification of their problem.  If you are looking around on &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Unix &amp;amp; Linux Exchange&lt;/a&gt;, two larger sibling sites with a lot of material pertinent to raspberry pi users, you will sooner or later run across some excellent examples of the self-answered Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've added &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/24752/i2c-device-inside-case-gpio-ribbon-outside-case&quot;&gt;an example of my own&lt;/a&gt;, based on something I did recently with the pi.  Notice that the protagonist of the question is essentially hypothetical (it isn't really me, I already had an answer). It is nothing spectacular, and all of the information is available elsewhere online, but this brings it together as a solution to a problem.  Most importantly, there's no real duplicate on site already -- &lt;em&gt;always check for those before you start typing.&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Self-answered Q&amp;amp;A's are a good fit here because experimentation and problem solving are what a lot of us spend a lot of time doing.  And, not only are they a nice way to share information with others, they are also great for making notes for yourself.  By having to communicate the information publicly, you've reduced the chances of abbreviating too much, etc.  How many times have you looked back at your own purely personal notes and wondered what the heck you were referring to?  This is probably worth more than any number of upvotes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also always the chance someone has an even better answer you hadn't thought of.  By the way: you can't accept your own answer immediately, but make sure you come back and do so when/as appropriate, since otherwise this could end up as just another Q with &quot;no accepted or upvoted answer&quot;.  Keep reading if you don't yet get why that's significant.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Dealing with Stale Unanswered Questions&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also need to provide more answers to normal questions, of course, but not indiscriminately.  If you think you have an answer, put it out there.  If it turns out to be wrong and gets downvoted, that's okay -- downvotes are important feedback on the way to becoming an even better contributor. It is not the end of the world, there's no shame in this; it is how the system should work.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're bored or curious enough, spend a little time with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/unanswered&quot;&gt;unanswered questions list&lt;/a&gt;.   Note that unless you select &quot;no answers&quot; in the lower tab bar, this list is actually questions with no &lt;em&gt;upvoted or accepted&lt;/em&gt; answers, but that is what counts statistically.  Hence, the easiest way to improve the stat is to upvote reasonable answers where they are found.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  Presuming the site stat is short of reality (that is, does not reflect the actual number of decent answers) putting in an effort to read a few Q&amp;amp;A's and cast a few votes is a corrective measure. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other aspect of dealing with unanswered Q's is to close or delete them as appropriate.  This activity tends to fall behind because it takes five normal users to close a question.  It only takes one moderator, but I am uncomfortable doing so with &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; questions if there is any ambiguity (meaning I'm actually one &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; potential vote in such cases).  However, having a question go without a decent answer for a month or more provides further indication that the question &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be inappropriate or unanswerable.  In this case, I'm quite happy to close them and have spent some time this weekend doing exactly that.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  So, if you are browsing through the unanswered list and find old questions that are candidates for closure, indicate so and they will go into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/review/close&quot;&gt;close queue&lt;/a&gt; where other users can concur; if I find them there (and again, they aren't brand new), there's a good chance I will do it by fiat.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But please, only questions for which there is a legitimate reason &lt;em&gt;besides&lt;/em&gt; being old and unanswered.&lt;/strong&gt;  Don't queue them for the reason that they are stale, just take into account the fact that they are stale as further evidence that they may be too unclear or broad to have received reasonable answers.  We also have a lot of off-topic questions that might easily already have an answer on another site; those can be closed.  However, &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; unanswered questions may get an answer at any point, and even if they do not, closing them sends the wrong message.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Increasing the User Base&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, focussing on increasing the quality of the Q&amp;amp;A's may reduce their number, which our daily average is lowish as is.  Improving that is our toughest task.  One thing I'm open to (keeping in mind, moderator != god emperor) is the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/477/could-more-arm-dev-boards-be-on-topic&quot;&gt;suggestion from Bex&lt;/a&gt; and others that we try and open the site up a bit to include questions from users of similar dev boards.  Exactly what that might mean I'm not sure.  The number of different devices in this category being sold to end consumers has increased quite a bit since this exchange started 2 1/2+ years ago, when the pi seemed like such a unique beast there wasn't much of a category.  From this I'd exclude things which use a proprietary interface specific to them, such as the Arduino (the &lt;a href=&quot;https://arduino.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;beta site&lt;/a&gt; for which appears to be doing well anyway).  We probably also want to exclude a name change, so really it might be a matter of starting to accept questions so that word gets around; &lt;a href=&quot;http://unix.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;U&amp;amp;L&lt;/a&gt; is better for &lt;em&gt;general&lt;/em&gt; linux questions, but we might actually be a better place for questions that have specifically to do, e.g., with the GPIO and I2C subsystems, since those are of no interest to the end user on most actual linux systems.  I'll look into what is and isn't possible and present a more fleshed out concept sometime in the next month or so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I'm looking into is bumper stickers, but please: if you stick these on mirrors in the library bathrooms, &lt;em&gt;I didn't give you the idea&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ideas?

Remember, we're not a straight-up discussion forum.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you ever want to bother me in particular about anything, I'll try and keep myself available &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/3748/the-bakery&quot;&gt;in chat&lt;/a&gt;.

I think we are generally a bit stingy about this.  Upvoting an answer doesn't mean you think it is the best possible answer (you can upvote more than one), it just means you think it potentially provides a genuine answer to the question.  Some of you may be from higher volume sites where votes are easier to come by, and some of you may just not have considered what the purpose and significance of the voting is, but if there's one thing you take away from this, I hope it is giving consideration to giving credit where credit is due.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2.

Beware it's for all S.E. sites, so make sure, e.g., &quot;raspberry pi exchange&quot; is indicated in the dropdown before you run a query, or you may end up with something else.

If we set this site as a come-one-come-all site where you can ask about any board ever, that might just be detrimental to this site - with questions that will never get answered, or will only serve a limited purpose because of the small number of users for said individual board.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One solution to this problem could be creating an initial list of commonly known and used boards and declaring those on-topic, and then allowing users to go through the Raspberry Pi Meta to suggest adding a certain board(s) to the on-topic list. Users could vote and if the Meta post reaches a certain threshold of upvotes the board gets accepted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Increasing the User Base&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;@Jivings made a &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/14083062#14083062&quot;&gt;great point in chat back in March&lt;/a&gt; (kinda shows how sad of a chat we have :( stars are still around from late-February/early-March 2014).

Obviously, he wasn't saying this in a detrimental manner, but it's true. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since the Pi is aimed at beginners to computing/education and is meant for getting people interested and involved in programming/computer stuffs in general, we're going to get a lot of people new to the Stack Exchange network and probably brand new to the world of programming/hardware too. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I many of the cases they have an issue, come for an answer, get or don't get an answer, and then leave - never upvoting or accepting the answers on their own questions, let alone getting involved in the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The other thing I'm looking into is bumper stickers...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ooo, if you want help, I'd love helping design these! :D&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="9475" LastActivityDate="2014-12-03T01:31:08.460" CommentCount="0" />

Looking at the unanswered tab it states that there are 1,351 questions with no upvoted or accepted answers (which with a total of 7,481   questions roughly accounts for 81% answered). So I take it that actually only questions are counting here that have no answers at all or no answer that is either upvoted or accepted? This leads to two questions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;why are there so many old yet unanswered questions and how to deal with those (read &quot;get rid of them&quot;)? &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;why are answers that are at least &quot;ok&quot; not voted for? Or as it is put in below-mentioned thread: why are we too cautious in upvoting (both questions and answers)?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know that the issue has been discussed before.

I consider the time I put in here worthwhile and it is nice to see others with time who presumably believe the same thing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The S.E. beta system is annoying, but I suppose they have a brand to protect and this an aspect of it. Although it leaves us in a bit of a limbo, what we have here is still something to be happy about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been intermittently trying to tackle the backlog of unanswered questions by going through and closing cruft chronologically.  Bear with me, because there's a way anyone can help with this, but I don't want to present it as &quot;here's how we game the game&quot; (i.e., I'd prefer if you indulge my philosophical ramble but feel free to skip down to &quot;What You Can Do&quot;).  My mixed metaphor theory about why our ratio is ostensibly sub-par is that the nature of the beast here is a sort of perfect storm:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There's &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of technology involved with the pi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Part of the success story of it and the blossoming of other &quot;development boards&quot; has to do not just with putting some hardware together cheaply, but of there being a market for it.  The technology was probably feasible a long time before the market was, because a substantial chunk of that market are people like me, who have evolved technical skills along one line or another over the past several decades -- often longer, I know, but in terms of numbers, probably growing exponentially with the explosion of the WWW.  Put another way, the Pi represents something whose time has come.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;This still does not make the (much older) technical aspect any different than the original core of S.E., Stack Overflow, where the focus is programming, or various other broader technical sites such as Electrical Engineering and Unix &amp;amp; Linux.  The new element is the pi.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Going back to &quot;there's &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of technology involved&quot;, it takes a lot of expertise to deal with all of the potential confusion, but the &quot;new element&quot; of the pi is a bottleneck with regard to channeling it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This means we end up with a lot of hard, sometimes dubiously answerable, questions, and not enough people to deal with them.  Part of what's frustrating with the S.E. system are the one size fits all aspects.  It takes five votes to do something on Stack Overflow, where there are probably hundreds or thousands of potential voters poised at any given time, and it takes five votes here.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the rep needed to get privileges is scaled (e.g. 500 here to cast a close vote, 3000 on S.O.) but perhaps not enough.  We have a tough crowd.  It is hard to earn rep here.  That is not unjustified, considering the nature of the material and the peculiar bottleneck -- but I think we could be a little more generous.  Having reasonable, responsible people with the 500 points it takes to go through the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/review&quot;&gt;review queue&lt;/a&gt; is important. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the aforementioned backlog of unanswered questions, a lot of these perhaps should have been closed in the first place but were not.  I think we have a very, very high ratio of closable questions in relation to other sites because:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;There's so much overlap with S.O., U&amp;amp;L, and E.E., and we cannot turn this into a place for people who own pi's to learn python, or the bash shell, or sysv init, or bit banging.  &lt;strong&gt;That's not fair to them in the end,&lt;/strong&gt; even if they don't get the picture right now.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A lot of pi owners get in over their heads very quickly, sometimes so much so that there's not really much that can be said.  I think people who are new to programming and computer technology often massively underestimate what's involved.  This doesn't mean those people are beyond hope, but it does mean some of the questions they are prone to ask are.  &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both these kinds of questions often get left open I guess out of a sense of optimism -- maybe someone will have a quick solution.  But once they are months and years old the likelihood of this becomes much less.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What You Can Do&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, with regard to upping our answered stat, I've been going through the backlog via the SQL powered &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;S.E. Data Explorer&lt;/a&gt;.  That front page is worth pausing on (at least in the form it was when I wrote this).  At a glance, it would seem that graduated-from-beta status is a little bit arbitrary.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  There are graduated sites that don't have stats much different than ours.  There are also some very broad beta sites that topically, one would think should have graduated a long time ago.  E.g., Philsophy S.E. is very interesting (at least in this regard...) -- what went wrong such that &lt;em&gt;philosophy&lt;/em&gt; rates only a beta site while (e.g.) &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/meta.tex/queries&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt; graduated?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moving on: The Data Explorer is a great place to hone those SQL skills! Joy! ;) If you don't know what that is, don't worry, you don't need to. &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/raspberrypi/query/252051/no-scored-accepted-answer-in-given-time-period&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Here's the query&lt;/a&gt; I've been using to get chronological lists of unanswered questions, mostly to find the closable ones (which to be honest is most of them).  Doing that effectively takes a mod hammer, but the other side of this coin are &quot;unanswered&quot; questions that actually have decent answers that were never upvoted or accepted, possibly because the O.P. did not get or care about the system (IMO, in case you-yes-you are still reading, &quot;doesn't care about&quot; is synonymous w/ &quot;doesn't get&quot; here).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upvoting only takes 15 rep, so that's most of us, but it does raise the stingy voting issue again since I think it may take a surprising amount of time for some people to get there, here.  Presuming you can upvote, &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/raspberrypi/query/edit/320828&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;here's a derived query&lt;/a&gt; that lists &lt;em&gt;all the questions with answers, but no accepted or upvoted answers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;  There's 306 right now, which is ~4% of our total. &lt;strong&gt;I am not asking anyone to just go through and upvote blindly&lt;/strong&gt; -- I could do that myself in less time than it took to write this -- but if you want to have a look, please do.  If you have the requisite 500 rep, you can also vote stuff into the close queue, which I will start perusing more.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Best of all: If you find questions you can provide a better answer to, do.  It is hard to get an upvote this way, unfortunately, which brings me to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;What Else You Can Do&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If going through the backlog is too tedious, then something that would help &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; is paying attention to &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;the &quot;active&quot; queue&lt;/a&gt;.  If someone going through the backlog finds a question they can provide a decent answer to, we then need people to upvote that answer if they feel &lt;strong&gt;&quot;this answer is useful&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; (that's the tooltip on the upvote widget).  Old questions with new answers appear in the active queue, and if you pay attention to the the &quot;modified by&quot; line, and the date on the answers, they are easy to find.  Note the ones modified by &quot;Community&quot; usually haven't been modified at all, they are just being randomly (I assume) bumped up for attention.  &lt;strong&gt;These are significant though since they usually are questions with no upvoted or accepted answer.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. Of course we do, inevitably &lt;em&gt;but arbitrarily,&lt;/em&gt; tackle questions of this sort, and there's no doubt a perceivable unfairness to that.  But, for better or worse, I think that's again simply the nature of the beast here.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2. Sort of like what I'm saying about how questions get dealt with here in footnote #1.  The nature of a different beast.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3. Beware the Data Explorer data is not live, it's updated once a week, but the links to the questions are real, so you may find stuff on that list that's been closed or upvoted in the meantime.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4. I haven't much since I was appointed moderator because I can't vote normally (i.e., as one of five) anymore.  My hand is a hammer and I'm hesitant to use it on stuff in the close queue since the community at large does have the opportunity to do so more democratically.  But as mentioned, complicating things, we do have a scarcity of voters.  So I'm going to go through the queue now and hammer some of the more egregious questions...&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:28.777" LastActivityDate="2015-06-01T20:38:43.863" CommentCount="1" />

We do have a (much neglected) chat room and in fact you have enough rep (&gt;= 100) to create rooms as well.  Pretty much everyone can access them (&gt;= 20, meaning it takes two upvotes on a new user).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, taking everything immediately to chat isn't necessary.  A quick request for clarification in a comment on the question is great if it elicits a response because the information is then right there for everyone else to see (even better if it then gets edited into the question by you, or the OP, or someone).  It seems to me that's &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what this one is, and it is a shame the OP did not follow up because if you look at the accepted answer, ifermon had to refer to two different scenarios which an answer to your &lt;em&gt;question&lt;/em&gt; could have resolved.  That's inconsiderate of the OP, although I think many people who only ever ask questions do not realize this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the role of moderator is to be a little bit mean to people in certain situations, such as when a questioner does not bother to reply to comments, leading other people to more work than they should have had to do.  The reason this is &quot;a little bit mean&quot; is because the OP likely just does not see the issue and will perceive me as trying to create a hassle, or acting power mad, or being dumb and annoying, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another example of having to seem mean would be this conversion-to-comment thing.  By making that an answer, you were explicitly inviting the OP to reply in comments to &lt;em&gt;a question&lt;/em&gt;.  If you want to talk one-on-one, chat.  If you want clarification on a question, &lt;em&gt;ask in the comments&lt;/em&gt;.  That's pretty clear cut.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  I can promise we could take this to &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Meta S.E.&lt;/a&gt; or poll all the world's moderators and the overwhelming majority are going to agree with Steve and I here.  Not because they are moderators and we like to maintain a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_wall_of_silence&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&quot;blue wall&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, lol, but because I think the issue is very clear if you have enough experience trying to make things work better.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think you are genuinely a helpful person, and there's nothing wrong with questioning our judgement, but have a little faith! Although I'm obviously biased, I really believe you are in good hands here moderation wise.  Unfortunately, it is not always something I enjoy because of the perception issues, etc.  I don't want to seem mean or annoying so please do everything right in the future. ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. Something you can do that's fine is post an answer &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ask a question (in comments on the question, not your answer), then use the information that comes out to refine your answer.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2. Part of the problem there that may not be obvious is you are then encouraging this very neophyte user to believe &quot;answers&quot; are individual discussion threads.  Keep in mind people who want help may really, really want help (I'm sure we've all been there) and if you give them an easy way out of making an effort to do their homework and compose the question, plus the opportunity to hold hands, they'll take it. I didn't end up here because I don't like helping people or answering questions -- before S.E., I was one of those people with &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of forum posts various places.  A  major reason S.E. has been a wild success (like, &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; major reason) is because people like me appreciate the structure.  That's something I'm happy to stand up for, even if it does make me seem mean occasionally.  I recognize the desire to jump in and start helping, but there are more and less efficient ways to do it, and it is a mistake to believe there is a limitless supply of help available and so using it efficiently doesn't matter.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2015-07-24T14:04:52.033" LastActivityDate="2015-07-24T14:04:52.033" CommentCount="5" />

I presume the reason it works this way is to prevent people from creating tags independent of questions, such that the tag would not be associated with anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you think there's a tag that should exist but doesn't based on a particular question, you can edit the question to add the tag, then edit the &quot;tag wiki&quot; to explain what it's for.  You're then free to search around for other questions to which the tag might apply, and add it to them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tag maintenance can be pretty tedious because recognizing an issue may mean going through bunches of questions.  This is one reason tagging is an ideal topic for &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/3748/the-bakery&quot;&gt;the chat room&lt;/a&gt;, because you can point something out, say what you've done, and then someone else may decide to pitch in searching and applying.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another thing to be aware of with tagging are &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/tags/synonyms&quot;&gt;synonyms&lt;/a&gt;, which are created by intention to avoid people creating two tags for the same thing, sometimes via typo (e.g., &lt;code&gt;raspbian&lt;/code&gt; vs. &lt;code&gt;raspian&lt;/code&gt;).  If you find two tags you think are synonyms, please ask about it here or in the chat room.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I wonder if that means it is a usability issue for new users?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A long term trend with interfaces and documentation seems to presume increasing amounts of user literacy.  As in, I think someone from 1995 would find contemporary smartphone apps hard to use, notwithstanding the fact they are supposed to be easy for someone who's owned a smartphone for a while. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not at all calling you &quot;user illiterate&quot;, Greenonline, just pointing out there is this tension.  I've been a daily user of S.E. for more than 3 years and I still regularly get confronted with my ignorance of the interface.  Whether this means it is too complex or not friendly enough is obviously a judgement call.  There's a lot of discussion of this kind of thing at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/new?show=all&amp;amp;sort=recentlyactive&quot;&gt;overarching meta-site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A fundamental concept in interface design is &lt;a href=&quot;http://community.bestica.com/profiles/blogs/ease-of-learning-vs-ease-of-use-they-aren-t-the-same-thing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;ease of learning vs. ease of use&lt;/a&gt;.  The classic example of this is a GUI vs. a CLI (command line interface).   GUIs have a much better ease of learning because you can just look through a bunch of menus to find what you are looking for but aren't sure how to do; with a CLI app you have to consult some documentation.  However, GUIs are also slower and more awkward to use if you do know exactly what you want to do and how to do it, hence, they have a worse ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The S.E. interface probably is geared more toward experienced users, meaning aspects of it sacrifice ease of learning for ease of use.  The use (or non-use) of copious &quot;confirm and/or explain&quot; pop-ups is part of that.  As a new user, I want all the help I can get.  As an experienced user, I want a minimum of steps and clutter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The best of both worlds could be achieved by providing a choice of styles and some configuration options, but that adds to complexity and maintenance overhead.  The actual composing/editing interface here has that in the sense that you can use the buttons at the top or you can just hammer out &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;...  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:28.777" LastActivityDate="2015-07-25T16:18:57.733" CommentCount="0" />

In the meta post on the closing of the site, Andrew, a Robotics pro-temp moderator suggested that four beta sites are merged together to create one viable Embedded Systems site:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://arduino.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Arduino&lt;/a&gt; (542 days in beta)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Raspberry Pi&lt;/a&gt; (1151 days in beta)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://robotics.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Robotics&lt;/a&gt; (1018 days in beta)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://embedded.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Embedded Systems&lt;/a&gt; (10 days in beta, closing down)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I collected some statistics from Area 51 for each beta (as of Aug 8, 2015):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Site      | Q : day | Answered | Users (200+ / 2K+ / 3K+) | A : Q | Visits / day&#xA;----------+---------+----------+--------------------------+-------+--------------&#xA;Arduino   |   9.5   |   72%    |      150 / 13 / 6        |  1.9  |     5106&#xA;Rasp.

However, I think every site could be helped by a merge, because they have actually a lot in common.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A search for &quot;Arduino&quot; on Raspberry Pi.SE yields 215 questions (2.6%), of which only 11 closed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A search for &quot;Raspberry Pi&quot; on Arduino.SE yields 71 questions (1.9%), of which only 3 closed&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Robotics.SE most used tag is Arduino (208 Q). It also has a Raspberry-Pi tag (57 Q)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Raspberry Pi.SE has an Arduino tag (100 Q)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Arduino.SE has a robotics tag (35 Q)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the great overlap between these sites: I myself am a hobbyist and a computing science student. I own a Raspberry Pi and some other embedded systems like Particle's Photon. I also own  I have worked with LEGO robots and Arduino. I have several modules that can be used with an Arduino which I use with PIC microcontrollers. I am currently working on a PIC32-based standalone text editor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not think we would have many issues defining a scope which is distinguished enough from &lt;a href=&quot;http://electronics.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Electronics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://programmers.stackexchange.com&quot;&gt;Programmers&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com&quot;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;.

Not exactly this question, however.  I mention this because I may still put that up later this weekend, and I don't want you to feel it was in reaction to this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;After thinking about the proposal for the monster merge (Arduino, Robotics, us, &amp;amp; Embedded), I am not convinced it is a good idea, although I am not vehemently against it either.  I have some pros and cons, but more cons...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Pros:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger community means more eyes and more expertise.  Although this might be mitigated by more work for them to do, I think if that were in proportion to the number of eyes, it would still be more efficient (because individual specializations will come more into play with scale).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of our current members are doing robotics and embedded work and/or use the Arduino, so may appreciate the more generalized community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Cons:&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm being slightly pessimistic here because I think if a combined site were to work it could be great, but if it didn't we'd have taken something that is decent, and has been stable for a long time, and trashed it.  Possibly three things, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A very high percentage of our questions are from people who are new to the pi &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Stack Exchange.  Because of our focus, we are a reasonably welcoming place for hobbyists, students, and &quot;newbies&quot; of all stripes. This is not to say we don't still expect a certain minimum effort from people, of course, or that we don't field questions from professionals and commercial/industrial users.  Changing our name, however, and watering the stream down with more-or-less unrelated questions, may intimidate and confuse some people; a lot of the questions we get on a daily basis may not get asked, meaning the people who would have asked them perhaps could not find &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; to ask.  That would failing the community that is supposed to be &lt;strong&gt;our raison d'etre&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this regard, it is worth contrasting our &quot;Visits / day&quot; stats (from the question) with the other sites; we have more than 3 times the volume of Robotics, Arduino, and Embedded put together.  Of course, Embedded did not really get a fair test, but both Arduino and Robotics have been around for more than a year; Robotics has been around almost as long as us.  Somebody is reading all this stuff (even if they don't/can't vote on it enough...), whereas the audience for Robotics and Arduino appears much, much smaller.  We may end up driving many of those people away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have 3+ years worth of questions, ~8200 currently, meaning unless some significant pruning were done, more than half the questions on the new site would be from here.  Since many of those were written on the presumption that they were being read on &quot;Raspberry Pi Beta&quot;, they may appear very confusing on a much more general site.  This can be mitigated a bit by adding a &quot;raspberry pi&quot; tag to all of them, but not much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decent proportion of our questions are not really embedded &lt;em&gt;development&lt;/em&gt; questions; they are at best questions about using a particular embedded system from a consumer perspective.  I'm thinking especially of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodi_(software)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Kodi&lt;/a&gt; oriented things, which are appropriate enough here but would be pretty out of place on &quot;Embedded.SE&quot;.  Those people could be shoe-ed over to U&amp;amp;L, but I don't think anyone would benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's fairly clear in the Embedded private beta that many of the people most excited about it were hoping for a site that would attract embedded developers (read: experts and professionals) from Stack Overflow to create a site where the quality is higher.  This is an enviable but very lofty goal, and if it fails, I fear those people (perhaps correctly) may blame the merge.  Since there will now be the Embedded mega-site (whose questions are 2/3rds about the Raspberry Pi or Arduino, presuming we both continue to generate ~10 questions a day, and Embedded + Robotics can generate 10 more), their chances of ever accomplishing that goal will be pretty much quashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I do not think we would have many issues defining a scope which is distinguished enough from Electronics, Programmers or Stack Overflow. After all, your site and the others have been doing that already for quite some time. Think of the suggested merge as the &lt;em&gt;least common multiple&lt;/em&gt; of the four sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something very interesting to me from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.embedded.stackexchange.com/q/69/38&quot;&gt;closure announcement on Embedded&lt;/a&gt; is this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Looking at recent technology betas the most successful sites focus on well-defined communities such as elementary OS, CiviCRM, Vi and Vim, and Emacs users and developers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those are some pretty obscure topics.  Although it could be that there are more vim users around than people with an interest in embedded development, you'd still think the latter a much more viable topic for an entire Q&amp;amp;A site.  So what's the deal here?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Notice the first thing on that list is for &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_OS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Elementary OS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, a &quot;Linux distribution based on Ubuntu&quot;.  But there's already a full fledged &lt;em&gt;Unix &amp;amp; Linux&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Ask Ubuntu&lt;/em&gt;!  How is this necessary or feasible? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think it has to do with the specificity.  I had not thought about it before, but it helps to explain why we have remained stable;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; people use this site because they are Raspberry Pi users.  It is, as you say, what &lt;em&gt;distinguishes&lt;/em&gt; us. I do think we could open our scope up somewhat to include &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; similar hardware (that's another question...) but going with the &quot;lowest common multiple&quot; may in fact result in something which pleases no one, unfortunately. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, there's an element of psychology/user perspective at play.  It seems to me this was no small part of the original impetus for the Embedded site: Some people felt they were getting a short stick on S.O., U&amp;amp;L, etc., and wanted their own place separate from that.  It is easy to say all these things fit together conceptually and I agree, but my experience as moderator tells me that many people, particularly if they are new to the whole SE system and milieu, won't be comfortable, making it &lt;em&gt;harder&lt;/em&gt; (not easier) to attract users with a broader scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. Full disclosure: I was not part of creating this site and joined when it was already a year old.  If I had noticed it in Area 51, I would have gone, &quot;Nah, that's silly -- too specific.

In particular, a clash of cultures and alienation of existing users is a big risk. Ultimately any stack exchange site needs to stand on it's own and now that permanent beta is the rule rather than the exception, we have to accept that small workable vertical sites may well be better than broader based, artificial amalgams. In essence, a strong &amp;amp; growing community, even if it is small, is preferable to a weak diminishing one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the long term, I hope that perpetual beta sites will start to get &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/259143/138432&quot;&gt;some of the benefits of graduated sites&lt;/a&gt;, even if it isn't worth Stack Exchange spending time and development resources on a custom site design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="141" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:31:52.830" LastActivityDate="2015-08-10T14:57:13.170" CommentCount="0" />

We’ve already begun work on your site's design, which will give you your own unique theme that reflects your topic, culture &amp;amp; community. This will help brand your site as unique, even while you share common elements with other sites that show you are part of a bigger Stack Exchange family.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There’s another big thing - once your site goes up, you will receive a link in the footer of other sites in the network, along with the ability to migrate content to and from other sites – and the notoriety of a public launch that says, “Congratulation, you finally made it!”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Design Concept&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this design was simple: create something that fits Your Community. A community of builders, engineers, and fans. A community of people who can go to a garage and build an Iron Man suit. A community of people who can build and program a working computer while on a lunch break. And so on, and so on… There’s a lot of fascinating stories behind your community. And there’s one thing in common — Raspberry Pi. That little green board which opens entire new world for you and other people and release endless source of creativity to build something amazing. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’ve also been reading tons of questions here recently, and I have to say that you’re a cool community - very friendly, chilled out, happy, and fun. We wanted to emphasize those values.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So yes, many stories are glued together with a Raspberry Pi board. That’s why this board became a symbolic theme for your site design. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Color Scheme&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Green - obviously. We’ve also added some red/pink from Raspberry Pi logo to remember the roots, where it all begun.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/yoNi9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Color Scheme&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Logo &amp;amp; Identity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/ShcY8.png&quot; alt=&quot;Process&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We didn’t want to reuse the existing Raspberry Pi logo. We did want to include two visuals that best fit this community:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Raspberry which symbolizes community roots and the device which is a foundation for everything you build.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Circuit boards which are the main theme of the site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/jMBU7.png&quot; alt=&quot;Logo&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;SWAG&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how it can be used elsewhere to strengthen the visual identity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/eTTLi.png&quot; alt=&quot;T-Shirts&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/6L0Hp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Stickers&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/WBtfX.png&quot; alt=&quot;Mugs&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/TLq7C.png&quot; alt=&quot;Badges&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Overall Site Design&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you were waiting for…&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEXpG.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/CEXpG.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bw96c.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/Bw96c.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We believe the design and branding work very well for this community, it’s unique and capture the right mood.

I'm not a huge participant there but I do glance through and read questions semi-regularly.  Before I jump into what I see the issues there being for us...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel like this will be a problem for the site going forward?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel it's already been a problem. We have never had enough people with close/reopen voting privileges, etc. That is partially because we also have a problem getting members to participate in the system to the extent that they already can, e.g., by upvoting and creating more high rep users. Making it a difficult ediface to budge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Put another way, the site has some peculiarities which make the one size fits all deal particularly awkward. However, most of the community on Meta SE isn't from here, and there's no real reason for them for them to be sympathetic to our peculiar problems. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, this problem is not so peculiar that it only affects us -- but I think many or most of the other sites it affects are still in beta.  We did not graduate because of our stellar leaderboard. To be sociological, taking this problem to the SE community at large means running into the inherent conservatism of any community, namely, if a problem doesn't affect most members but it does imply the entire group has to change policy, they will tend to take this as an affront and respond that they haven't been wrong up to now and therefore there's nothing wrong with the way things are now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, since &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-september&quot;&gt;the policy around graduation recently changed&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and this change is no doubt part of why we did graduate, we could in fact be considered an exemplary case of a site which deserved to be graduated under the new policy but that makes apparent the need for some more policy adaptations.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone already brought this up for discussion in pretty much that form several months ago:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/261525/can-we-make-automatically-scaling-reputation-thresholds-work&quot;&gt;Can we make automatically-scaling reputation thresholds work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The response was pretty underwhelming, which is still better than &quot;overwhelmingly negative&quot;, but it does imply there is not enough interest for anyone in a position to act to take notice. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, the discussion seems to have stalled at that point and the best place to start would be to pick it up there. It could be something that will become more of an issue if a wave of similar long term beta sites are graduated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, not an impossible goal, but don't hold your breath or get your hopes up.  Based on this question and that one from Meta SE, the focal points of the issue might be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;That the jump from &quot;beta&quot; to &quot;graduated&quot; thresholds might be better done with a scaled system than involves saying we want/need a certain percentage of overall users with certain privileges, then set the thresholds to achieve this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A point of resistance to this is fairness: How do you then deal with the system over time?  Should privileges once awarded be permanent?  If so, at what point should the thresholds which filled the quota from the last point be set?  Or should they constantly roll up, meaning, the number of people with particular privileges remains tied a percentage of total users, but who those people are may change?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to deal with the issue of a &quot;stale pantheon&quot;, whereby users can accumulate high rep by virtue of being long term but not necessarily active?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind again that part of what makes things problematic for us is an unusually low participation rate in terms of voting; the last point would not be such a big deal otherwise (meaning, again, the system already works as is most places). Part of what we have to do is justify why this is the the nature of our peculiar beast, and something that is unlikely to change, but should be acknowledged and adapted for because there is some reasonable explanation for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. That's not exactly an explanation of that but contains a lot of discussion about it, including, unfortunately, a reference to the &quot;strong support&quot; for &lt;em&gt;raising&lt;/em&gt; privilege levels as part of the process.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-20T10:31:52.830" LastActivityDate="2015-11-19T14:52:40.823" CommentCount="4" />

I would agree, but as I was trying to hint at in my answer to Jacobm001's question, the SE community at large (read, those who frequent &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt; and the actual staff) can be extremely ideological in the bad sense, meaning the idea is more important than the reality, and even when the idea clearly does not work, there is always a reason that can be concocted to justify sticking with it, because the idea was perfect in the first place and it would be impossible for reality to contradict that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of our 14 users who can now use the queue, 3 are the mods, and the majority (including me, for a reason I'll get to in a moment) haven't looked at the queue since we graduated and likely many of them never will.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It of course only takes one vote to put a question in the queue, and dollars to donuts a big percentage of people who've done that (vote to close) don't deign to bother with the close queue itself.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it takes 5 non-mod, non gold-star-in-tag (I'm not sure if we have anyone in the latter category) votes to close a question, the chance of the queue working in that sense at this point is very low -- I suspect not one single question has been closed by this mechanism since we graduated and it will be a long time before one is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is perhaps that I don't look in the close queue. I've said this a few times elsewhere, but my attitude is that the community should have the opportunity to do this without me having to act by fiat all the time (so I'm strongly disagreeing with Steve on this point, that flags are an appropriate solution).  Note that I've already closed &lt;em&gt;more than 1000 questions&lt;/em&gt;, more than 10% of the total, and 4x more than Steve who I guess is the runner-up.  Many/most of these were actually questions from years ago; I spent a lot of time going through old cruft in an attempt to improve our &quot;unanswered questions ratio&quot; looking for things that either had an answer that deserved an upvote or should have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The system is not intended, I think, so that sites are effectively maintained by one or two all powerful figures -- that is not what the role of moderator is supposed to be, and that is not how it works on most other non-beta sites.  Unfortunately, it is also a one size fits all system and completely hamstrings itself in this case.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I'll start using the close queue (this is more in line with the ideology, of course, because, &quot;You should vote to close because you think the question should be closed and not leave it up to the community to do so&quot;).  I also intend to see what I can do to get our privilege levels adjusted or (gasp!) change the system, since there are other members and moderators around who also see it as highly problematic.

But there are also a number of times where I at least &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that the &lt;strong&gt;answer&lt;/strong&gt; will be the same/similar, but the question may not be a duplicate. The reason for this is that drivers are pretty much always tied to a chipset and therefor the &lt;em&gt;wifi-part&lt;/em&gt; of the question will/should have the same answer. I mentioned &lt;em&gt;wifi-part&lt;/em&gt; because often they want a good working wifi to accomplish a goal. And because there's often &lt;em&gt;another-part&lt;/em&gt;, it (often) doesn't qualify as a duplicate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What would be a good way to tackle this issue?&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Create general question like 'Wifi problems with the &lt;code&gt;8192cu&lt;/code&gt; driver' ? And then create one per chipset a priori? Or point in the comments to other questions where the &lt;em&gt;wifi-part&lt;/em&gt; is asked/solved? Downside of that is that it's quite repetitive and also doesn't give you any points (afaik). Is there another way to link questions, besides marking them as duplicates? Questions marked as duplicates 'end' the discussion of that question which may not be appropriate/desirable. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The suggestions I've given are precisely that and nothing more.

Is that possible here&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, every question is sticky-esque in the sense that if you have &lt;em&gt;&quot;canonical answers to canonical questions&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, and those can be found relatively easily by using a search like this, the results of which can be sorted by various criteria (e.g., score):&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[tag][tag] is:question &quot;some phrase&quot;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then saying &quot;Before you ask, use the search&quot; is sort of like saying, &quot;Before you ask, check the stickies,&quot; presuming that people will actually read the &quot;Advanced Search Tips&quot; (a dropdown sidebar on the search results page that, alas, you actually have to run a search to find) and/or &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/searching&quot;&gt;the help page for searching&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harder, at least the first few times, than browsing stickies, but also more dynamic.  I think it reflects a paradigm of the information age that has evolved since the invention of the sticky together with average &quot;user saviness&quot;.  There's a lot of information and there's a bar representing the extent to which the user &lt;em&gt;should be expected to be able to sort it out&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;strong&gt;Easier is not always better.&lt;/strong&gt; We're setting that bar slightly higher than with the sticky.  In order to use the internet effectively, you first must know how to read.  If you then use the internet enough, you should develop additional skills peculiar to it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course there are a few problems with this.  First, new users most in need of a sticky are least likely to be able to use the search effectively.  This leaves the onus on the community; if you see a question that you know has been asked and answered a bazillion times, search for the most canonical match with a decent answer and flag or vote it closed as a duplicate; see below also about the idea behind &quot;duplicate chains&quot;, since those also have some conceptual parallels to stickies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A second problem is that rarely do things fall together so tidily that we have one canonical umbrella question covering a tree of subsequent duplicates.  This is a problem with stickies too, which tend to tackle the issue with a sequence of if-else posts and amendments. In this case the &quot;harder but more dynamic&quot; mechanism is probably of net benefit.  Trying to construct duplicate trees/chains from existing questions, when you notice the potential for such, is a nice thing to do. One means of doing this is suggesting them here for discussion (esp. since creating the links probably requires help)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;there are also a number of times where I at least think that the answer will be the same/similar, but the question may not be a duplicate&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not usual. Having a duplicate require approval from a moderator or 4-5 members of the community with sufficient privileges provides some oversight with regard to, &quot;Is this really the same question or not?&quot;.  Actually editing the question is okay too, as long as you are certain you are remaining true to the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;duplicate chain&lt;/strong&gt; is a sequence of duplicate questions; i.e., where a question is closed as a duplicate of another question which is closed as a duplicate of another question and so on (but hopefully not too many &quot;and so ons&quot;).  I imagine some people see this and go, &quot;What the heck? Why would you close this as a duplicate of something that was closed as a duplicate?  Why not just close it as a duplicate of the original?&quot; A pragmatic reason for not doing that is it can become difficult or impossible over time.  The end of the chain is not necessarily &quot;the original&quot; in the sense of was written first (see below about &quot;the general question&quot;) and things may get shifted around periodically -- although here that is hard to arrange without a moderator, since otherwise it requires 5 people with close/reopen votes working together via chat (or of course, a meta question here).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We don't actually have all that many such chains.  Anyway, in addition to the pragmatic cause, idealistically, they can form a sequence of &quot;sign posts&quot; such that people searching from one perspective will find their way to the same solution as someone coming from another perspective, if in fact they are both really looking at the same problem.  You don't need a chain for this principle to apply, but it may help in some cases.  As an example WRT wifi, sometimes people think something has to do with their particular adapter, when in reality it's not even a wifi issue but a general networking one, so there might be a duplicate chain from a question about the adapter to a question about wifi in general to a canonical Q&amp;amp;A about networking.  Following these sign posts hopefully clarifies the real nature of the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;What would be a good way to tackle this issue?&#xA;  Create general question like 'Wifi problems with the 8192cu driver'? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When that's possible, yes.  If this potential general question ends up involving too many arbitrary &quot;if-else&quot; type cases though, consider making it several questions.  Also beware...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And then create one per chipset a priori?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I would avoid that ambitious a project, and only adhere to it as a pattern in so far as it turns out to be useful.  I.e., don't create a mold and then try to squeeze everything from a list into it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A good example of a recent general question on the topic of wifi was Milliway's &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/raspbian&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;raspbian&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;raspbian&lt;/a&gt; tagged &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/37920/5538&quot;&gt;&quot;How do I set up networking/WiFi/Static IP?&quot;&lt;/a&gt;, (which he called a &lt;em&gt;Dorothy Dixer&lt;/em&gt;, adding to my repertoire of Australian slang).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bringing us to the topic at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;And in order to fix that there are a number of things that should always be provided:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's a good list, to which I'd add:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Output from &lt;code&gt;ip link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ip addr&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Output from &lt;code&gt;lsusb&lt;/code&gt; (you sort of covered this with the USB ID)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But not all these things will be relevant in all cases.  This is an area in which linux's heterogeneity becomes a serious issue for new users.  There are so many different possibilities in terms of the default system configuration and means of diagnosing a problem that when something doesn't work, and you aren't familiar with the system, in order to get anywhere you really need some knowledge of basic networking that most end users don't possess and/or unusually good problem solving skills.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hence we see a lot of exasperated users with wifi problems.  Many of these are solved by people recognizing the likely cause without too much further inquiry, but many of them dead end at the point where the amount of diagnosis required is just too great to do in an online Q&amp;amp;A context.  &lt;strong&gt;We cannot be expected to solve &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; problem&lt;/strong&gt; of this sort -- which doesn't mean the problem can't be solved, just it may require a lot of work and patience on behalf the person with the problem, because they may have to go off and research and tinker and ask other questions.  But, as with many tech related issues, that is the nature of the beast.  An analogy might be to cars or medicine.  Can you find answers to questions about your engine or abdominal pain online?  Sure.  Does this mean doctors and mechanics are now obsolete because all we need is access to the right information?  Probably not, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/your_mileage_may_vary#Phrase&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;YMMV&lt;/a&gt;.  At some point you might find you have to go to the doctor.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;An original intended purpose of the Raspberry Pi is education. IMO this begins for some people sooner than they would like (as in, &quot;Yes, I will get on with the learning as soon as someone tells me how to get my wifi to work&quot;).  I am sure we all encounter this kind of frustration.  &lt;strong&gt;We are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; product support staff for the Raspberry Pi Foundation, GNU/Linux, Adafruit, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;  People cannot expect us to be held responsible for their problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very often with tech problems I end up having to learn more than I ever wanted to know about something that turns out to be more nuanced and complex than I would have ever guessed.  Again, that is the nature of the beast.  What we are here to do, I think, is to help each other learn, learn how to learn, etc.  This includes things like how to research online, how to read documentation, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;How to Ask Questions the Smart Way&lt;/a&gt;, etc.  It is not, as they say, just a matter of a free lunch or &quot;give me da code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, it would be nice for all involved if there were some tidy way to deal with all these pesky networking problems, but I suspect there is not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:27.120" LastActivityDate="2015-12-12T17:04:58.090" CommentCount="4" />

As a moderator Keeping, interchanges civil and quickly addressing users concerns over tone, language and content (i.e. flags and comments) can go along way to addressing this, especially if done quickly. so that animosity does not fester. As a moderator sometimes a well timed/placed comment can make a big difference and smooth the waters between people - especially since we are inherently a somewhat impersonal written medium with many members for whom English is a second language. Some parts of communication are lost or can be misconstrued in written form). A simple example of how a small change can make a big difference is presenting a search result back to a user. saying have you seen this is far better than using &quot;let me google that for you&quot;. The latter basically says go away don't bother me. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As for converting noobs into active community members I think two things can help here: first, taking advantage of the teachable moment, by which I mean helping them learn to help themselves. This includes teaching them where to find help (e.g. man pages, reading an error message) how to ask better questions (see my comments here raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/39187/…), second, taking advantage of the gamification system baked into SE by encouraging them (after determining the problem) to answer their own question, vote or ask a new question. This gives them a little boost of self confidence (to stick with the Pi and this site), a reputation bump, and a badge or two. It also affords them the opportunity to pay it forward (see the comments to my answer here for an example - raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/2059/…). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a moderator I should be held to a higher standard then the rest and lead by example (something I am sure I do not always achieve but that I do strive for). Though one thing that has helped is conferring with the other mods about a users behavior so as not to allow my own bias/annoyance etc. become an issue. Moderation should be seen as a team sport. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The products made by the Raspberry Pi foundation are aimed at all ages and skill levels, including children and beginners with technology.

It takes the whole community. The moderators need users to flag posts, help work through the review queues, add comments requesting clarification and providing guidance into how things work here. Moderators can however, provide a united consistent voice and policy, handle the flags that other users have raised and lead by example (posting comments that help turn poor/weak questions into good ones, voting up good questions and answers). @goldilocks and I have both stated that we feel a bit heavy handed when unilaterally closing a question. As moderators it only takes our one vote to close a question as opposed to five community member votes. In the few cases where I have done this it was clearly off topic etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In past we have chatted about the best way of handling individual user issues (we actually have a private mod chat room that we use for this). Sometimes this has been handled in comments, private chat with the user, user annotations and even the occasional suspension. We have always started these conversations by noting the good and encouraging that behavior, and then pointing out the negative aspects of their actions and their effects on the wider community. We have also swapped roles (good cop bad cop), when a user has raised an issue with one of us personally. This collaborative approach to managing negative user behavior has been one of the most rewarding parts of being a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have had this come up a few times and we have chatted about it and come to a consensus that we felt was best for the site, and that we could all agree on or support. Occasionally it led one of us to a change of opinion and the question being reopened, sometimes we convinced the other of our point of view and the decision stood. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;As a Moderator it is conceivable that the users of your Stack Exchange Community will ask you about a desirable feature for your Community that the parent SE organisation either does not currently provide, or can never provide. How would you work out the difference and what would you aim to do for each?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would try to determine what the OP really wanted - this is not always clear, nor always aligned with what they are asking for, what benefit they thought would be achieved by the new feature, how existing features could not meet this need etc. Next I would try to determine why SE could/would not provide the requested functionality, via chat or meta and if they had any workarounds or similar requests. If they had similar requests perhaps we could follow up with the mods from these other communities with a similar request/dilemma. This would allow us (the mod team) to understand and articulate the differences and any potential solutions to both parties. I would also remind the user that not every want needs a feature, and somethings are inevitably not ideal in a one size fits all world. They may be no entirely satisfactory answer, but at least you can help both parties understand the other's perspective.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators maintain community standards, first among these is the edict to always be nice, but this also includes making sure the questions are in line with the site's scope as described in the FAQ and eliminate bad behavior and violations of the standards (spam etc.).

The moderator role is different from a high rep user, instead of answering questions, you spend more of your time keeping the site tidy, welcoming and working to grow the community. You may not see your reputation grow as fast, but moderation provides its own rewards and sense of satisfaction - seeing the site graduate and hold elections chief among them. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="56" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:50:49.097" LastActivityDate="2015-12-14T21:57:39.113" CommentCount="2" />

  <row Id="662" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="655" CreationDate="2015-12-14T23:30:11.813" Score="2" Body="&lt;p&gt;It's Ghanima. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Preface&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I believe in the power of the crowd and cooperation. Therefore it is my firm hope that a mod only has to step in in the rare cases where self-regulation fails. I see the work of moderators as part of the work the community does as a whole - after all Stack Exchange is community moderated and moderators are also just &lt;em&gt;users&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is my understanding that the community members should define the goals and policies of the site together (e.g. in meta), with the mods aiding to focus this process and helping to implement the agreed upon procedures. As a moderator I would like to act as part of a team on behalf of and to the benefit of the community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;What do you think are the biggest issues Raspberry Pi SE could face in the future - and how as a moderator would you go about solving them?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a follower of the &lt;em&gt;Mr. Robillard school of moderation&lt;/em&gt; I find it hard to come up with an answer better than his. My previous experience as a user of RPi.SE suggests that neither troublemakers nor technical issues are a big problem of our site - but this view might be somewhat limited if those issues just did not surface due to the good work of the pro-tem moderators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So as of now I concur with the assessment that nurturing a helpful and welcoming community is key for a successful growth of our site. The advantage of SE is its high quality answers. To keep it that way new users will have to be turned into active community members who are eager to share their knowledge. Fishing for enthusiastic new users will also help to broaden our base of knowledgeable experts for the evergrowing family of models of the Pi. I very much like the idea of the &lt;em&gt;teachable moment&lt;/em&gt; and pledge myself to take greater care of it - regardless of being elected mod or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being welcoming is also where I see the whole community in charge with the obvious fact that a moderator should be held to the highest standards in leading by example (to use the well-worn phrase). I completely agree that the moderator should quickly step in to arbitrate disputes. Respecting the user and with fair and impartial actions I hope to live up to your expectations. I consider clear and open communication key to resolve conflict. As stated above I firmly believe in cooperation and think that the feedback of the fellow community members as well as the team of mods shall keep those good faith in line.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The products made by the Raspberry Pi foundation are aimed at all ages and skill levels, including children and beginners with technology. As such, many of those who use this site for the first time may not be familiar with the ethics of our site (and the internet in general). In the past this has brought &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/634/2015-moderator-election-qa-question-collection/638#638&quot;&gt;many low quality questions and answers with problems&lt;/a&gt;. We have a huge backlog of these questions and answers, and while some of these have been fixed, most of them have not. &lt;strong&gt;As a moderator, what can you do to help clean up this site, and keep it clean in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My history of flagging, commenting, voting, and editing should speak for itself. I will continue to do the housekeeping work at leisure (&lt;em&gt;mod or not&lt;/em&gt;, any case), including commenting and editing to guide new users. Besides that I take it that this a task to be carried out by the whole community (as it is today). As is pointed out the tools of the moderators are quite powerful when it comes to closing, and have to be used with care. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to handle the backlog and the huge stack of unanswered/no-accepted answer questions is a question of future policy that I would like to have determined by the community (e.g. in meta). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again it's clear and open communication to be named as key. Addressing the user directly (as per &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/&quot;&gt;a-theory-of-moderation&lt;/a&gt;) should help to mediate and resolve disputes or &quot;diversities in interpretation&quot; if you will. I strongly hope that the teamwork of moderators (as Steven mentions it) will be kept up to address such issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Communication again. A team a three moderators should discuss the issue (which I expect to show up only rarely) and decide what serves best the goals and the development of RPi.SE.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;As a Moderator it is conceivable that the users of your Stack Exchange Community will ask you about a desirable feature for your Community that the parent SE organisation either does not currently provide, or can never provide. How would you work out the difference and what would you aim to do for each?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From my experience in the work place I know that it's worth to double check and figure out whether what the customer tells that he wants is really what he wants. If that issue is settled, the community should back the wish of an individual user considering the potential benefit to the site. I have brought up a feature request on meta that will have to stand up to the community opinion whether it is worth the effort or not - the same thing I would expect for any request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With this concensus the issue could be brought up to meta.SE and/or discussed at other sibbling sites that had similar requests. In time this might lead to either a solution to the wish or an understanding that (and why) it is not possible to implement it. The outcome would need to be communicated through meta.RPi and in the hope of the understanding of the initiator. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I like the phrase &lt;em&gt;Moderators are human exception handlers&lt;/em&gt; very much. So I take it that a mod has to step in in the rare cases where self-regulation fails, those exceptional conditions that could otherwise disrupt the community. The answer to most of those situations boils down to communication - with the attributes we expect from our moderators: patient and fair, respectful and polite. Besides that I understand that a fair share of the housekeeping is part of the moderators work, e.g. processing the flagging queue and maintaining .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As this is my first nomination I have no experience with it, but I acknowledge that the communication between the community and SE both in terms of escalated moderation and with respect to administrative or technical tasks is part of the job, too.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Despite using a pseudonym here, I am pretty confident that my previous posts reflect well - save issues of the language barrier or the fact that a nerd's mode of expression &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; sometime come off as a little rude. If you ever find me cross the line, just give me a hint. I am not above reconsidering and apologizing. I take responsibility for what posted in the past and what I will post in the future, so in fact, the &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; diamond does not make me feel dizzy. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Reaching 10k rep could be a matter of years. Gaining mod powers now is therefore not a question of being &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; effective but &lt;em&gt;earlier&lt;/em&gt;. In meta and chat we lately discussed the issue of the sudden rise of reputation levels to access numerous moderation privileges due to the sites graduation. With a comparably small base of active high-rep users this could lead to a larger backlog in review and flagging queues. Being a mod will allow me &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; to be of greater use.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;(Disclaimer: English is not my native language, so please excuse my bumpy phrasing.) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19949" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:50:49.097" LastActivityDate="2015-12-14T23:56:12.057" CommentCount="6" />

For a smaller SE site, particularly one which overlaps a number of larger ones, this presents a challenge to participation, which in turn affects the number of users with sufficient reputation to cast close/open votes, edit without approval, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, these are not insurmountable obstacles. A moderator gets to make a lot of little decisions involving scope, something we have some leeway with.  By remaining attuned to what's going on and making judgements about what is possible, we can exploit this flexibility to grow and/or focus the site.  It will take time to accumulate more committed high rep users, but as we do so we will become more defined and tightly knit as a community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The products made by the Raspberry Pi foundation are aimed at all ages and skill levels, including children and beginners with technology.

As a moderator, what can you do to help clean up this site, and keep it clean in the future?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've spent more than a few hours with &lt;a href=&quot;http://data.stackexchange.com/help&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;the data explorer&lt;/a&gt; going through a large backlog of questions with certain characteristics (no accepted or upvoted answer) and reviewing them.  I've closed hundreds of very stale, hopeless questions this way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also been rigorous about insisting &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; questions meet certain standards, while trying to avoid scaring too many people off.  We are an intersection of widely varying skill sets, levels, etc. and this requires a degree of sensitivity.  One of the things I have shied away from that I intend to pursue more going forward is radically editing questions rather than closing them -- not just spelling and formatting, etc., but taking something that is too broad or unclear and turning it into something clear and specific and still useful to the original author.  Where feasible, this could be a more productive demonstration than, &quot;Sorry, please try again.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That would depend a bit upon the exact nature of the flags, etc. Someone who contributes positively more than negatively deserves consideration, but not a license to commit murder.  We have very few problems of this sort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People who are very aggressive, annoyed, or annoying are best dealt with in private chat, where perceived audience is not a factor.  A one-on-one padded room dynamic can be conducive to coming to a mutual understanding.  I am very happy when I can achieve that and believe it is almost always possible, particularly with people who demonstrate a desire and ability to produce good content.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having multiple mods ensures there is a degree of oversight, but it is primarily about sharing the workload.  That is negated if we are constantly second guessing each other -- it should not take three people to screw in a lightbulb. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am comfortable with other people having perspectives which are not identical to mine.  Closing questions is sometimes a nuanced judgement call.  If another moderator makes a different call than I would have, I would have to feel strongly about it in order to contradict them, in which case I would first discuss it with them privately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Steve and I are mostly copacetic, but on occasion one or the other of us has asked &quot;Do you mind if I reopen this question you closed?&quot; and that's fine.  I think the most important thing there is to actually communicate via chat before acting and diminish the chance for any misunderstanding.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;As a Moderator it is conceivable that the users of your Stack Exchange Community will ask you about a desirable feature for your Community that the parent SE organisation either does not currently provide, or can never provide. How would you work out the difference and what would you aim to do for each?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I would do would be to dig around &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Meta SE&lt;/a&gt; and see if this has already been proposed and discussed in the past.  The &quot;Teacher's Lounge&quot;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is also a good place to investigate this kind of thing.  I'd then pass that information on, and explain a purpose of Meta SE (open to everyone) is exactly this kind of proposal. If I thought the proposal viable and worthwhile, I might offer to help them with it. This is not strictly necessary, however, and I'd prefer to see people get involved themselves rather than me taking the ball.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in my self-nomination, moderators are the most privileged members of a system which allows users to play a significant role in how the &quot;limited supply and demand economy&quot; of Q&amp;amp;A is regulated. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've put in &lt;em&gt;thousands&lt;/em&gt; of hours answering questions here and on other SE sites, and before that, other technical forums. I benefit from the work of others doing much the same thing. I am a believer in the power of knowledge, information, and communication. The internet is an important tool, and &quot;crowdsourced&quot; conduits of information such as this are one of its most impressive aspects. What moderators do is try to keep it impressive. More specifically, I wrote that while providing answers is obviously fundamental to the existence of a Q&amp;amp;A site,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;...being a moderator is not about answering questions. It is more often about deciding which questions can be asked. This helps to define the community and keep it sustainable.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators by and large are people who have provided a lot of helpful answers. Having done so doesn't just mean &quot;you are good at this stuff so you should be moderator&quot; -- we &lt;em&gt;represent&lt;/em&gt; the supply side of the equation.  That the site and answers are free does not mean this supply is infinite or without value.  First and foremost, moderators are here to ensure that attitudes and misconceptions on the demand side do not squander the supply.  We're also here to nurture that supply by helping other people who want to help.  Hopefully this adds up to everyone finding the help they need, even if sometimes they need to put in a little work to get it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My analogy is not intended to imply a sharp distinction between a Q group and an A group or an S group and a D group so much as illustrate that sites like this are resources which can function and be used more and less efficiently.  What moderators do is make decisions about, and try to focus other user's attention upon, the details that make the difference between &quot;more&quot; and &quot;less&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I stand behind what I write.  This does not mean I never make mistakes, but when I do I make an effort to rectify and own up to it. I do think that the role of moderator places an extra burden upon you to exemplify a model of behaviour, but I don't think that needs to mean sacrificing one's individuality or idiosyncrasies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mostly in the obvious sense that being able to do simple things like close/reopen questions by fiat makes it easier to do more complex things like those mentioned in my answer to #6.  Being able to edit (my own) comments without a 5 minute time limit is also useful; I communicate a lot with comments and often put as much thought into them as I might an answer. Comments on questions are a key place for providing insight and guidance to people new to the system and/or confused by a particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being a moderator probably also helps in being taken seriously when someone is frustrated and might prefer to ignore something they don't want to hear. There's a lot of frustration to find in technology such as the Raspberry Pi, and often there is no quick and easy way out of it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1.

I believe that over time this issue will probably solve itself, but in the mean time, we'll need a significant amount of effort from our moderators. If the moderators are too light handed, we could easily see quality of the site slip, but holding the reins too will certainly produce the same result.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second risk I see is how our site tends to see surges in new users. When the Raspberry Pi Foundation releases a new device, there's always an influx of new users. These users are often completely new to the RPi and Linux as a whole. Sometimes I believe that our official scope is too narrow and our response scares away new users. We often bend/flex/break those rules on a case by case basis, but as our discussion here on Meta has been leaning, it may be prudent to widen the scope, at least by a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the time of this writing, we have 29 items in the close queue. While we were in the beta phase, we were often able to keep that number much lower, often at 0. To help clean the site, and to keep it clean moving forward, I think the moderators are going to need to take more decisive action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past our moderators have been more hesitant to act in the queues because they wield a hammer rather than a vote. I respect that position, but I think we're going to need to wield the hammers a little more strongly in the coming year. The challenge will be for the moderators to be open and honest about their actions, in a system that wasn't really designed for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would try to be upfront with the user about their behavior. I would try to address that while their contributions are valuable to the community, their behavior is not. If one and one communication doesn't work, I would bring at least one of the other moderators. If they agree, I would give the user a warning that clearly states the consequences of not abiding the sites rules. If the warning is not heeded, I would suspend the account.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's fairly likely that moderators will disagree, at least on occasion. My first course of action would be to message the other moderator. They may have more information than I do, which would obscure their reasoning. If we could not come to an agreement, the best course of action would be to bring in the third moderator. We would need to work as a team, and even if we can't all agree on a course of action, my hope is that the third moderator could break the tie, and we could come to a reasoned course of action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a moderator, part of my responsibilities would be to act as a go between for the users and the greater StackExchange community. If the users would like to see a feature provided by StackExchange that doesn't yet exist, I would first try to see if there was a solution that we could implement ourselves.  After that, I would discuss the the request with other moderators.  I'm sure many of our sister communities have already gone through many of the problems/requests we will face, and may have come up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Exhausting those options, I would bring the request to the StackExchange team themselves (I'm assuming mods have some kind of avenue for this...).  If they implement the request, the users and I can call it a job well done and celebrate. If they decide not to for whatever reason, I will forward the information they give their response to the users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't mind the limelight. I will try to be as cognizant of that diamond as I can be, as I realize that it will mean that I represent this site to a far greater degree than I already do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently, I have a reputation of a little over 2,100. Reaching 10,000 or even 20,000 could take a very long time, let alone 20,000. Being a moderator would allow me to start participating to a greater degree much more effectively, and more quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8496" LastActivityDate="2015-12-16T03:42:47.320" CommentCount="0" />

Because two of the lighting circuits will be wired in parallel to &quot;normal&quot; switches it is desirable that the Mains Relay circuits to control them also have feedback to the controlling Pi to sense if the lights are already switched on manually - so some opto-isolator feedback on the switched outputs from each Relay is desirable, otherwise I'd be tempted to use some properly designed [SF Innovations](http://www.sf-innovations.co.uk/mains-switch-relay.html) relay units, note the spacing/clearance/fusing/cable-restraints between the &quot;Mains&quot; bit and the &quot;Control-circuitry&quot; - the lack of that is what makes many &quot;RPi Relay Units&quot; NOT SAFE for use in Mains Power applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fire/security alarm&lt;/b&gt; Having a set of [Aico](http://www.aico.co.uk/Accessories-RadioLINK.html) Fire/Heat/CO alarms with Wired/Wireless interlinks it seems a good idea to interface with those via a wireless Ei413 interface.

I understand that a lot of people have this problem, and if they do they should post the output of any files/commands they can still access like &lt;code&gt;dmesg&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;/var/log/messages&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;/var/log/syslog&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/var/log/kern.log&lt;/code&gt;. Though, most of the time when the Pi won't boot, they have access to none of these files. In that case the op should add what they did to the Pi in the days/hours/minutes leading up to the crash/no boot. The odds of a Pi just dying is pretty slim, so they must have changed something. Also, even if the Pi will not boot at all 99% of people will have access to &lt;code&gt;/boot/config.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/boot/cmdline.txt&lt;/code&gt; which I assume could contain some very important information in most cases.

I could send this to &lt;a href=&quot;https://skeptics.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Skeptics&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://communitybuilding.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Community Building Beta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a bit of a complication with that, however.  All SE moderators also have access to a (fairly busy) chat room, whose purpose is partially to allow us to &quot;super ping&quot; each other.  Pinging, that is, addressing someone in a comment or chat like this: &lt;code&gt;@goldilocks&lt;/code&gt;, has a restriction.  It only works if that user has already posted something in that context.  Super pinging is a moderator tool allowing us to do that to any user from chat regardless.  We can only do so in chat rooms belonging to the site where we are moderators, obviously, and in the mod chat room (more or less).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;community managers&lt;/em&gt; (CMs) who are actual SE staff are generally accessible there too; these are the people who, e.g., arranged our election, graduated us from beta, etc.  Anyway, point being, if I did migrate this to Skeptics someone would likely want to know why in the fairly near future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I did not investigate to confirm, but I believe the thinking around migrations has shifted over the years; right now creating actual paths that normal users can vote on via &quot;close&quot; is unusual but the ones that have existed (we don't have any) still exist.  The number of questions that require migration is small enough to task this to moderators.  I don't use it automatically; e.g. programming questions that are off-topic here are not necessarily sent straight to Stack Overflow.  I have a few reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It is very simple to cut and paste a question anyway.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;I feel it is more polite in many cases to explain a question is off-topic and let the author decide what to do.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Often questions would require some editing to reflect a different context.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes this happens many hours after the question was posted, and the timestamps are not changed.  This means migrating to busy sites puts such questions pages back in the &quot;new&quot; queue.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question you are thinking of was deleted by the owner after I closed it here.  Closed questions do not necessarily have to be deleted and some of them (e.g. most duplicates) should not be, but particularly since that one was reposted to the main site, it might as well have been.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also wrote in a comment that the question as written was too broad and should be split up, which was why I did not simply migrate it.  The OP did not do that, which was his decision to make, but got an appropriate answer that seems to have pointed him in the right direction, as he later posted a more detailed one himself.

Everyone is excited about what they are doing and no doubt would love to have a team of experts pour over it and contribute.  However, this is not very feasible, and we are not a discussion forum.

However, as a moderator, I sometimes have to distinguish between my own feelings and the community I'm suppose to serve.  No doubt a good portion of that is also not impressed and I will explain why I did not stop this from happening.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you look at the original question, it is very simple and brief:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is there a 5V rechargeable battery and cables compatible with raspberry pi zero? I don't want to have to plug my raspberry pi in every time and nonrechargables get expensive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Very likely there is one duplicate or another available for this.  &lt;em&gt;But:&lt;/em&gt; At that point it was actually a decent canonical form.  It also refers explicitly to the zero in the title.  Of course, the zero is not significantly different than any other model in this sense. But some things to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've had a lot of new questions about the zero like this, and they &lt;em&gt;have proved very popular.&lt;/em&gt;  I.e., they have been up, not down voted.  And please do not now go on a crusade, I believe you are more of an adult than that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since people have also been eager to answer them, rather than telling everybody &quot;No, please move along&quot;, this seemed like an opportunity to make the point in a friendlier way and help draw people in rather than push them away.  It also gives us a dupe no one could take issue with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also an opportunity &lt;em&gt;to revisit and improve upon past questions&lt;/em&gt;.  A frequent problem with questions from 2012 here is that if you close everything as a duplicate of them, no matter what, people will keep coming back and insisting they want an update.  And frankly, not all oldies are goodies anyway.  &lt;strong&gt;Closing duplicates does not have to occur in historical order.&lt;/strong&gt;  If a newer question stands a better chance of serving as the canonical case, then it is much more sensible to close older questions as a duplicate of it.  It is not always possible to edit and rephrase to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a bit of an aside, as they say there are two kinds of people in the world: People who believe there is only one right way to do things and people who believe there are usually multiple right ways whose ultimate correctness is not, and may never be, truly resolvable. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  I'm one of the latter.  I know that it may sometimes make me appear contradictory here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I took a couple of minutes to provide a simple answer (it's still the same) at the same time as Steve did (also unchanged, note they are three minutes apart).  So now two moderators have answered the question, it is pretty clear which &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; approach we are taking.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unfortunately&lt;/strong&gt;, the OP then decided what he said in the first place is not what he really meant.  I was very tempted to exercise another &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; way and hammer it closed.  I won't say that I went against my better judgement though, because I did not see leaving it open anyway, to allow it to resolve itself openly, as a bad decision either.  I did make my personal opinion clear in a few comments but gave the OP the benefit of the doubt as a moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't regret that.  Understand that we are not SO, EE, U&amp;amp;L, or a brain child of Meta. I have nothing against those sites or the general principles of SE, which I sense you are trying to be very orthodox about.  In fact, I think I've probably argued more loudly &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; those principles here more than anyone else.  Literally, anyone.  However, as with all forms of orthodoxy, it has its pitfalls, and I certainly do not believe SE has achieved perfection in form and it is just a matter of properly applying that perfect system.  I also do not believe we should feel bound by the imperfections and orthodoxy until such time as they change: That approach is actually a &lt;em&gt;no change&lt;/em&gt; approach and implies we are already living in a perfect creation of a perfect being within which any deviance is therefore a corruption and devaluation of the whole.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to believe that way of thinking died with &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;logical positivism&lt;/a&gt;.  Unfortunately, the computer scientists and other technically educated people who make up the bulk of the membership here and elsewhere on SE often seemed to have skimped on the liberal arts electives whilst getting their educations and we are bogged down in a perpetual version of &lt;em&gt;The History of Western Thinking 101&lt;/em&gt;.  Put another way, if I were to take one extreme &quot;right&quot; way of doing things at this point, I'd close &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; question and suspend you for having admitted to using voting in an inappropriate way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not at all a threat ppumkin -- I like you and I'm glad you asked the question.  I'm just pointing out &lt;strong&gt;if we are all going to play hanging judge all the time there's going to be a lot of hangings&lt;/strong&gt;.  I don't think that is in the best interests of the community in the end (&quot;Whoops! I guess that wasn't the right way after all!&quot;).  That question was harmless, and as evidence of the fact that leaving it open was a good idea, we might look at &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/40543/5538&quot;&gt;the first answer to hit the floor after the OP changed the question&lt;/a&gt;, which I am very happy with and evidently so was the OP.  It addresses concerns people might have particularly in the context of the zero, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, I hope you will reconsider downvoting that one at least.  Not everybody capable of providing good answers is interested in office politics and I would hate to think that these politics stand in the way of people doing the actual fundamental work of providing useful answers to questions.  Tai Viinikka deserves praise, not punishment for that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. The savvy will note an old python vs. perl thing here from the days when python programmers at the highest level had a significant inferiority complex and even felt obliged to pick fault with the TIMTOWTDI philosophy in official documentation. Ironically, if people really approached the world in a &quot;we already have a right way to do all this&quot; manner, python would never have existed because it is completely redundant in that sense.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;demonstrations of interesting machines using Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

E.g., you've implied that the documentation itself in this configuration file is wrong. Is it still the same on Jessie? I could not find this file in that location on a current Jessie lite image, so I can't say, but it seems something has changed.  I checked on another site where I have the same 101 rep and there is the &quot;Answer your own question&quot; tickbox at the bottom of the &quot;Ask Question&quot; page, these are encouraged (presuming you make good use of the mechanism).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since this is a gray area cross-over topic with &lt;a href=&quot;https://unix.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Unix &amp;amp; Linux&lt;/a&gt;, which has a much larger user base and available expertise on this kind of issue, you could ask about it there.  Hopefully, the issue would then be definitively settled, and you could add another comment with a link to that question, which would be more likely to attract the OP's attention and that of the general reader (particularly someone who's looking for a solution to a problem).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that you cannot edit other people's posts arbitrarily without approval until you have 2000 rep.

If phrased that way it's very ease to say. Yes, indeed, it should be specific to the Raspberry Pi. If it is a coding issue not related to the Pi it fits SO better. If it discusses general Linux issues that are not related the arm-build of the Pi or certain hacks to the distributions of the Pi it fits U&amp;amp;L better.

BTW: I think there should be an actual &lt;code&gt;off-topic&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;bad question&lt;/code&gt; tag but my efforts to do that in the past mysteriously failed -- go figure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That leaves only two questions:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/42735/wiring-diagram-software&quot;&gt;Wiring diagram software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Where there are two other, more specific tags, and the foundation one is a bit superfluous, and finally,&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/14884/has-the-rasberry-pi-website-taken-on-a-new-theme&quot;&gt;Has the Rasberry Pi website taken on a new theme?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which may or may not have been the result of an April Fool's day joke -- leading to my suggestion:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Close the tag!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As in, leave those question and disallow any more.

The problem will more likely just change shape -- e.g., people creating new superfluous tags, which is harder to deal with.  At least this way we have a well known honey pot. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coming to a straightforward decision: Replace it with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/history&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;history&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;history&lt;/a&gt; (and probably plain &lt;code&gt;foundation&lt;/code&gt;) tag.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:28.777" LastActivityDate="2016-04-06T12:05:30.423" CommentCount="4" />

Since all our model names are &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/720/pi-model-tag-naming-is-not-consistent&quot;&gt;now prefixed&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;code&gt;pi-&lt;/code&gt; (no raspberry), the only tag to pop up is &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/raspberry-pi-foundation&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;raspberry-pi-foundation&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;raspberry-pi-foundation&lt;/a&gt;. Hence, they choose this tag, after not being able to find an appropriate tag with minimal &lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;(no)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; effort.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How can we stop this behaviour?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By removing the word &lt;code&gt;raspberry&lt;/code&gt; from the tag, or by coming up with another name entirely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we simply name the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/pi-foundation&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;pi-foundation&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;pi-foundation&lt;/a&gt;, then users searching for &lt;code&gt;pi&lt;/code&gt; will see all the version and library tags instead of this single tag, therefore increasing the chances of them picking an appropriate tag.

If you think you know what that info is and can edit it in, great, but more often there's two choices:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask the OP to provide the information in comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vote to close the question as &quot;unclear&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course the latter takes 3000 rep, which is a bit absurd around here, but there's nothing that can be done about that.  It should also usually include a comment elaborating at least a bit on why the question is unclear.  Closing this way is just a more forceful way of getting people to provide information and make an effort, or if that is too much to ask, we're all spared having to make any more effort on the Q as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that I pretty much as rule never close a question without some explanatory comment.  There are occasion exceptions to this, including if someone else has already made such a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's actually a third option here which I encourage people to consider:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Just ignore the question and move on to something else where someone &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; made an appropriate effort.  Nobody has an infinite amount of time to spend answering questions, and providing/working with good examples provides, well, good examples.

He doesn't even have to eat it.  Who cares?  All that matters is that he pays for his order.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this is a very bad analogy.  Taken to an extreme, it implies that something which is free must be in infinite supply -- just about the only thing this really applies to is numbers.  You can have as many unique real numbers as you want.  They are in infinite supply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Information, at least in an appropriately digestible form, is not. For that reason, in order for an information resource to work most effectively, that resource probably needs to be managed one way or another.  Part of the way this is done here is via closing questions, something users with a sufficient amount of reputation, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/site-moderators&quot;&gt;community elected moderators&lt;/a&gt;, can participate in.  In the latter case it is a de facto expectation that they do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To understand this, we need to to first understand that we &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; dealing with a supply and demand economy, but money is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a mechanism used to structure it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;demand&lt;/strong&gt; side of the economy is the questions asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;supply&lt;/strong&gt; side of the economy is the answers provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;As is often the case, the supply side is ultimately the governing factor.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in the world may want ten cars, but until there are ten cars for each of them, this demand cannot be met.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A question is asked &lt;em&gt;by a person&lt;/em&gt;, and an answer is provided &lt;em&gt;by a person&lt;/em&gt; (in some cases, as in this one, it may be the same person). A phenomenon new or casual users may not be familiar with is the significant imbalance between the number of people who ask questions and the number of people who provide answers.  This is the case here as it is, as far as I am aware, on &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; Stack Exchange site.  Have a look at the profiles at the top of &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&amp;amp;filter=all&quot;&gt;our leaderboard&lt;/a&gt; and consider the number of questions asked and the number of answers provided.  Right now, here's what they are for the top five:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;joan: 1705 answers, 2 questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;goldilocks: 1373 answers, 24 questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Steve Robillard: 466 answers, 4 questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Milliways: 1111 answers, 36 questions&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Jivings: 137 answers, 10 questions.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since it is very unusual for the same person to provide more than one answer to a question, it does not take a math genius to figure out that these are far from what the site average would be.  While gaining reputation is most easily done by answering questions, this still does not explain why there is this extreme disproportion between who provides the supply and who provides the demand in the Q&amp;amp;A economy.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speculating about that is beyond the scope of this question -- it suffices that we understand it is the case, as it illustrates the extent to which what I said earlier is true: Supply is the governing factor here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being the case, a significant issue for managing the economy is setting a bar on demand without raising our prices, if we consider &quot;prices&quot; to refer to the money we do not charge.  However, if we think a little harder, it may start to make sense that the zero dollars you pay for service here &lt;strong&gt;does not&lt;/strong&gt; equate to you needing to make zero effort in order to be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Questions which are unclear because they lack information -- often because the questioner has not made sufficient research effort first to clarify for him/herself what that information might be, but also often because the aforementioned &quot;billionaire in a restaurant&quot; assumption equates to laziness -- &lt;strong&gt;place a disproportionate strain on the supply&lt;/strong&gt;.  Put another way, they usually involve &lt;em&gt;greater demand&lt;/em&gt; on behalf of the questioner than can be met by the supply without imbalancing the economy.  This is why we expect:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You make a reasonable effort to do some research online beforehand to gather some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.ca/?gws_rd=ssl#q=context%20dictionary&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;contextual&lt;/a&gt; information for your question.  By &quot;research&quot; I mean reading pre-existing material, not asking someone to write some customized for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You make an effort to express yourself clearly, include relevant details, and &lt;em&gt;be explicit about your problem&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Two of the most common examples of a failure on this last point are &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378&quot;&gt;XY problems&lt;/a&gt; (the examples in that answer are excellent illustrations of exactly how bad questions place more of a demand on supply) and an attitude that could be summed up this way:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I don't have to explain the details of my problem because that will take too long and/or I prefer to share as little information about what I'm doing as possible.  However, that doesn't mean I can't try and ask a question, just that instead of explaining a problem, I will ask for all of the possible explanations for a vague delineation of it.  The ones that don't apply can be discarded and it doesn't matter because &lt;strong&gt;like a billionaire at a restaurant, I can afford to throw away as much food as I like&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully the extreme selfishness in this is obvious.  To be fair, some people do not do this consciously, they are just inexperienced in the world of sharing technical information online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Something I often recommend to people, although it is a somewhat long and rambling read (probably just looking through it for 15-20 minutes is enough to get the point), is Eric S. Raymond's &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;How to Ask Questions the Smart Way&lt;/a&gt;.  The original was written more than 15 years ago, when the context of &quot;sharing technical information online&quot; was primarily via usenet or mail lists.  However, what you see before you did in fact evolve out of that context.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Raymond&lt;/a&gt; was a significant influence on the embryonic development of the free&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; software community without which the Raspberry Pi would probably not exist.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Why can't I just ask whatever I want and leave it up to other people to decide individually whether they want to answer it or not?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The option for users to downvote and close questions is partially that, with a significant tweak: We can decide &lt;em&gt;no one&lt;/em&gt; may answer this question, at least until it meets certain minimum standards.  Here's a few good reasons for that:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It helps us save each other's time by indicating this question as it stands should be considered a waste of time, or as I described earlier, something which would place a disproportionate demand on supply.   You are not the only person looking for help, and to be fair, the people who make a better effort asking for it are given priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;It prevents people who are eager to answer questions, but in fact do not possess the necessary knowledge to do so, from filling a void.  A bad answer &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; better than no answer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For people who are new to the whole realm, it helps them to understand what they are doing wrong when they ask a question.  Although this may involve some bluntness at times, it is ultimately a kinder policy than just ignoring them and/or setting them up for a &quot;let the blind lead the blind&quot; scenario (all apologizes to the visually impaired).  While there may be a fine line between that and rude, this is a bit an eye of the beholder issue.  When in doubt, &lt;strong&gt;err on the side of &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoia_(psychology)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;pronoia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as opposed to presuming someone is intentionally trying to hurt your feelings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. There were some other steps in this &quot;evolutionary&quot; chain, and as with biology, newer is not always better and the old often continues to co-exist, usually because they fill different niches which is part of why Stack Exchange is explicitly described as &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; a discussion forum.  It isn't a mail list either, but no one would mistake it for such.  Mail lists, for those who have never tried to use one, are still in widespread use and you will often find answers there you won't find here -- if you can find the right list.  Note they tend to place an even higher bar on demand than we do, whereas the bar with discussion forums tends to be lower, which is likely why much of of the &quot;supply side&quot; has steadily migrated to Stack Exchange over its ~10 year history, beginning with Stack Overflow, which is certainly now the undisputed, far and away, most significant place for &quot;sharing technical information online&quot; when it comes to general programming topics.  Just in case you think I am trying to imply we have an analogous relationship to the Pi Foundation's discussion forum, I'm not and we don't ;)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2.

However, while it does describe a major use case for that command, it might be construed as misleading in relation to what &lt;code&gt;man apt-get&lt;/code&gt; actually says about &lt;code&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;.  Further, since &lt;code&gt;apt-get&lt;/code&gt; is in the process of being depreciated in favour of an integrated &lt;code&gt;apt&lt;/code&gt; command, I'm not sure what the future is for &lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;, and there were only 3 questions with this tag, one of which also has &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/update&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;update&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; on it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I merged &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dist-upgrade&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;dist-upgrade&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;dist-upgrade&lt;/a&gt; into &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/update&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;update&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; as well and expanded the wiki for the latter to hopefully dampen any confusion.  I also made it a synonym; the purpose of doing so in this case is to prevent someone down the line from re-creating a &quot;dist-upgrade&quot; tag -- attempting to do so will invoke the synonym and add &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/update&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;update&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt;, which is more reasonably scoped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;rpi-update&lt;/code&gt; is a specific tool, I clarified the blurb and wiki a bit and otherwise left it as is.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastActivityDate="2016-06-13T04:13:35.460" CommentCount="0" />

In fact right now we only have &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Reputation&amp;amp;filter=all&quot;&gt;20 such users&lt;/a&gt; and at a glance (you could confirm this crudely by checking the &quot;last seen&quot; stamp on their profile tabs) I would guess less than half of them are very active, and of the ones that otherwise are I would guess not all of them bother with the queues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Further, all three moderators are in that category.  While I don't recall discussing this with Steve or Ghanima, I have in the past made my own feelings known about an issue with &quot;the mod hammer&quot; -- namely, it takes 5 user votes or &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; moderator vote, and I cannot switch back and forth.  If I vote to close something it is closed.  Because of this, the close queue is the one I tend to use least as I would prefer to leave it up to the slightly more democratic and community oriented &quot;5 normal users&quot;.  I'm already the hanging judge of Rpi.SE, having closed ~1500 questions (i.e., somewhere close to 10% of the total; note the total figure does not include deleted questions, and questions that are closed with no upvotes or answers get deleted automatically after a certain time).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is a necessary tool but it is a hammer and one must be careful with hammers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure the last time I did access that queue, but it has to be &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; a week ago (although not more than two, since I seem to have some closures via queue indicated this month). However, I'm still the sixth icon in the pile, meaning during that time only five other people have accessed it, and no one can vote on the same question twice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So closing via the queue here is a slow process. In my opinion, this is not our fault, beyond the fact that the community is probably unusually stingy with upvotes, making it difficult for people to rise the ranks (and here's a tip: Go through that same list of top users and see how many &quot;votes cast&quot; is shown on everyone's profile tab; some of our most highly regarded users seem to have either very little regard for the system, or very little for other users...).  As I have tried to indicate many times, the tooltip for the upvote icon on answers begins &lt;em&gt;&quot;This answer is useful...&quot;&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;&quot;This answer deserves a Nobel Prize&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;&quot;This answer helped me personally&quot;&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;&quot;This answer is outstanding&quot;&lt;/em&gt;. A similar logic applies to questions.  Being useful should be sufficient to receive recognition for your efforts.  I forget this myself too often as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, beyond that, Stack Exchange uses a one size fits all system with those numbers.  It's 3000 rep, 5 votes on Stack Overflow, and 3000 rep, 5 votes everywhere else (except Beta sites, where the rep level is much lower).  If this seems a little ill conceived, I agree, however, having done some digging into the issue on &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Meta.SE&lt;/a&gt; and gone through at least one brief discussion in the (moderator/staff only) &quot;Teacher's Lounge&quot; chat room, I can summarize a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are other moderators of small sites that are also concerned this is a dysfunctional mechanism that would be better dealt with using some kind of scaled/proportional standard (although the ideas around this come with their own problems and complications).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of very active, high rep Stack Exchange users are against us, end of story.  As is often the case amongst significant majorities in democratic contexts, many of those in the majority don't need to bother to listening to arguments contra their own perspective and instead simply repeat warped, straw dog interpretations such as, &quot;You just want to coddle people&quot;.  If the numbers of those screaming the warped straw dog interpretations drown out their opposition, then that opposition never gets a chance to be heard.  End of story again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It might be worth observing that there is also a sizable percentage of aforementioned very active high rep users (likely with 100% overlap of the previous group) who have made it clear some smaller sites including this one should never have been allowed to exist in the first place, and if we take the whole realm a little too seriously and construe it as highly politicized (which perhaps it is), then it is in their &lt;em&gt;political&lt;/em&gt; interests to see those sites handicapped by rules which pave the road to failure, even if they know the rules are not fair.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don't worry though, we are not currently on such a road, our user reputations are slowly but surely increasing, and we are doing a reasonable enough job of filling a niche not to have to worry about any elimination game.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1.

It is worthwhile to separate the issues that seem to have gotten entangled thus leading to a heated discussion. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Links to relevant research or external references are encouraged on StackExchange but they should always be put into context. Problem with a google-link are that it is a) not persistent - if you refer to &quot;the second hit&quot; today that might be something completely different from the second hit next week - and b) that it seems to contain lots of links that are completely unrelated to the Pi - thus off topic. My understanding is that Steve pointed out this problem in his first comment. Be aware that he is saying that the &lt;em&gt;most of the links are off topic&lt;/em&gt; - not the question itself. He also provides some input on additional possible causes (power/heat issues) that could be reason for or contributing to the problem you describe. Those may or may not be worth investigating. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Again, key to helpful use of external URLs is to provide context to all your links. First and foremost all posts (Q's and A's) at StackExchange should stand on their own. External sources should provide additional information or backing up the claims you make. In my book that includes that you - the OP - pick the relevant links from the google search and make it clear to the reader of your question how they relate to your problem. Extract the relevant info of a few selected links and boil it down to one or a few sentences. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Think of it that way, the way your question is written as of now you expect the reader to follow up on multiple external links to figure out what you &lt;em&gt;might have&lt;/em&gt; tried. If you were to put that in the question in the first place it would reduce the guessing on the answerers side and thus potentially leading to more useful answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19949" LastEditorUserId="19949" LastEditDate="2016-08-05T07:39:37.717" LastActivityDate="2016-08-05T07:39:37.717" CommentCount="0" />

How do I disable the ABS and power steering in order to stop this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I.e., it reads as a complete non-sequitor and implies 1 of 2 things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who wrote it is very, very dazed and confused, has practically no experience using the internet, doing technical research, or asking for help online, and also does not understand anything about cars, and most likely is a new driver who has never had any trouble with one previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The person who wrote the question created that link while writing it as an excuse for supporting evidence, knowing anyone who clicked through would not bother reading any of it and hopefully presume #1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's nothing wrong with #1, and at first glance that's the way I would take this question, until I looked at your profile, which led me to your S.O. account, which makes me much, much more inclined to see this as #2.  And there is a problem with that.  It is indicative of contempt for taking things seriously and making an effort, so the idea here that this is really &quot;a statement and link to research of a problem&quot; is a bit hard to swallow, and the fact that &lt;strong&gt;you did not include a link to the question here&lt;/strong&gt; further implies you know that could easily contradict the twisted picture you are trying to paint.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will break down Ghanima's point a little more.  Here's what that &quot;research&quot; link is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/search?q=rpi3+lock+up&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=rpi3+lock+up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Any normal human adult who has used google for any length of time on one computer (or with a google user account) and paid any attention at all must almost certainly recognize that &lt;em&gt;the hits returned by this link depend in part on the search history of the person who clicks it&lt;/em&gt;.  If most of &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; prior research on the pi pertained to bluetooth and wifi before you composed the question, perhaps you made a naive mistake.  Still a bit hard to believe though, since you obviously are not a person with no experience doing technical research or asking for help about it online.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any case it does not explain, if you genuinely &quot;visited the relevant links&quot;, why you would not link to them directly.  Unless, of course, if that would complicate your claim...further evidence that the link, like this question, was &lt;strong&gt;an intentional rhetorical ploy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me, it leads to a bunch of stuff very much akin to the &quot;Ford Taurus engine trouble&quot; links.  Is there a pattern there?  Maybe if ran analysis on the first few thousand hits I could say there is.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's have a look at the top five. Probably they are not that different than those of someone who never looked for anything involving this, as I would tend to use &lt;code&gt;&quot;raspberry pi 3&quot;&lt;/code&gt; (quoted as a phrase), not &lt;code&gt;rpi3&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;amp;t=142481&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&amp;amp;t=142481&lt;/a&gt; This does indeed include the phrase &quot;lock up&quot; and &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; bluetooth apparently turns out to be the culprit, but what's interesting about it is bluetooth was not mentioned in that person's initial report of an issue.  It's mentioned in &lt;em&gt;the solution&lt;/em&gt; and what's more, &lt;strong&gt;exactly how to disable it is also mentioned&lt;/strong&gt;.  So if you already found a solution in the first link of your research, why are you asking about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://github.com/raspberrypi/linux&lt;/a&gt; Nothing to do with any of this but may indeed be indicative of my google chrome browser history since I'm there at least a few times a week.

Since they were posted a week apart, and the person who posted #1 found their solution the next day, very likely it was because of this.  But you do not mention PS3 controllers in your question...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/44232/raspian-migration-from-raspberry-pi-2-to-raspberry-pi-3&quot;&gt;Raspbian migration from Raspberry Pi 2 to Raspberry Pi 3&lt;/a&gt; A question from here where the solution appears to have nothing to do with bluetooth or wifi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/the-raspberry-pi-3-t3256-80.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;http://www.runeaudio.com/forum/the-raspberry-pi-3-t3256-80.html&lt;/a&gt; Completely tangential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on this, I'll hazard a guess and say that if I did run analysis on the first few thousand hits, &lt;strong&gt;there would be no pattern involving lock-ups caused by bluetooth and wifi&lt;/strong&gt;, and it certainly is not, as you labelled the link, research demonstrating anything about &quot;the frequent lockups reported by others&quot;. In other words, your question here should be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Is a statement and an incredibly pathetic excuse for research considered off-topic? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, it's not considered &quot;off-topic&quot;, and no one voted to close your question as such.  It should be considered pathetic, low quality, and demonstrative of, as the downvote tooltip says, &quot;no research effort&quot;, and so at this point has received a number of those.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By my reading of Steve's initial comment, &quot;off topic&quot; refers to search hits which are a random assortment that do not mesh with the topic of disabling bluetooth and wifi.  Note again, he did not close the question, so he obviously did not mean &lt;em&gt;your question&lt;/em&gt; is off-topic here, and the sentence is literally:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A link to a google search where most of the links are off topic really!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your misinterpretation is then born out in further comments on the question -- which, again, you presumably did not link to because you are trying to paint a different picture than the background reality presents &lt;em&gt;and you know it&lt;/em&gt;.

Many questions have also been asked about running Python. So what?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition this statement has provoked &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/34067/32351&quot;&gt;an answer&lt;/a&gt; that is about identifying Pis which is not what the OP wants, as he stated in the comments to that answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps my initial description was not clear enough. I'm not particularly looking for a way of identifying the Pi's. I already have that covered. What I'm looking for is to run one or more bash commands by altering the /boot/cmdline.txt file. This all without the need of logging in via ssh - even once.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;rephrase to make the point clear&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Others - including myself - have time consuming issues while trying to deploy a batch of fresh Pi's.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So what he's really doing is deploying a set of RPis. Therefore I simplified to&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm trying to deploy a batch of fresh Pis, [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;make the background of the question understandable:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some people have tried to identify Pis. Why? Because when you flash an image, all Pis are the same. But you don't want them to. IP conflicts are bad etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How does that relate to OP's problem? Making a Pi uniquely identifyable is very similar to what the OP wants: deploying a batch of Pis.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next we have 4 statements: a) when you deploy a batch of Pis &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt;  b) your question title is&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Use /boot/cmdline.txt for creating first-boot script&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; c) your task is similar to making Pis identifiable &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; d) you're saying that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;While the creation of custom images could be a solution for these issues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;then each of these custom images is individual (or &quot;unique&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore I wrote the sentence like this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The creation of custom images for each individual Pi could be a solution for these issues&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;highlight the differences:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OP gave the statement&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;With (only) the /boot directory open for access on regular machines (Win/OSX) &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;which clearly indicates that he does not want individual images but the same image for all Pis. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefor I highlighted the difference here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I'm wondering if there are easier solutions that involve a common image for all Pis&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;emphasize the only option left:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMHO the original question sees 3 possible solutions: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;a) boot the Pi and modify it then. Obvious, but involves lot of effort: insert SD, boot, open terminal, execute command, ... So that's not what OP wants.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;b) Modify the IMG file before flashing (&quot;custom images&quot;). Also involves a lot of effort: boot a Linux machine, mount the image, perhaps even resize partition, modify file, unmount, ...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;c) Modify &lt;code&gt;cmdline.txt&lt;/code&gt;: same IMG for each Pi of the batch, write to SD card, then modify the file, since it is easily editable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With all the knowledge before, OP does not want all Pis to be the same, so I edited this to be an &quot;individual&quot; text:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;[...] to pipe an individual text to a bash script [...]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: I spent some effort understanding what OP wants, reading the title, the question, the answers and the comments.

Of course that is the reason why I found the question I edited.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To Ghanima, it may have looked like I'm trying to edit another person's question to get an answer to my question, which &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; is an exact duplicate considering all the above.

However, since suggested edits aren't &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; reviewable by the OP, quite often by the time you're aware they've passed through the process which qualifies the edit as rejected or accepted. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This happens to me all the time on busier sites on the exchange, where dis- or ap- proving an edit may take place fairly quickly.  However, in this case what I think occurs is you get a notice that your post was edited, and it may be that if that edit has already been rejected you don't get any notice at all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Suggested edits are in a review queue and anyone with 500 rep can deal with them -- I believe it takes two people to concur this way, or possibly one person &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/privileges&quot;&gt;with more than 2000 (or 20000?)&lt;/a&gt;, or of course one moderator.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm trepadatious about using the &quot;mod hammer&quot; in the &lt;strong&gt;close&lt;/strong&gt; queue because this otherwise requires 5 community votes and we have a limited number of people with the reputation required to do so, so I like to leave it up to them keeping in mind it can easily take days to happen.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regard to the edit queue, though, I have no such qualms because generally speaking edits aren't contentious -- and looking at the mod accounting the three of use have between 500-1000 edit reviews each (Ghanima's numbers specifically, I hope he does not mind me quoting them, are &quot;approved 1023 edit suggestions and rejected 97 edit suggestions and improved 52 edit suggestions&quot;).  This is also one of the more boring tasks but &lt;strong&gt;one of the ones that it is important to deal with quickly&lt;/strong&gt;, lest people who make an effort at cleaning up stuff (there's always some left to do) become discouraged because it takes days for trivial corrections to spelling and grammar to get approved.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the first time I can remember one warranting a meta post, so it's pretty unusual.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking at the original though, it appears as innocuous as most -- there's nothing there that would give me pause one way or another.  I'd be inclined to do as Ghanima did mostly because of the removal of the 1st sentence, and the addition of &quot;I'm wondering if there are easier solutions that involve a common image for all Pis&quot;, both of which are substantive changes that deviate from the intent &lt;em&gt;expressed&lt;/em&gt; in the question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That the OP is copacetic with Thomas is great, but in general when reviewing edits as someone who isn't the author, it doesn't really make sense to concur with something this far out, particularly if there is no reason apparent -- perhaps if it reflected material in comments which qualify or change the question it would be different. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also an important part of the picture:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;This is not something in which the feelings of the OP are the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; consideration.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I roll back an edit by a question's author if it involves substantive changes to a question which other members of the community have already taken time to provide an answer to, and these changes would render those answers out-of-context.  &lt;strong&gt;This is disrespectful toward others,&lt;/strong&gt; whether you are conscious of it or not.  If you suddenly decide you didn't mean what you've said to that degree, you should write another question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, if I were reviewing it and took the time to look at &lt;em&gt;the answers&lt;/em&gt;, that substantive change in removing the first sentence, which is explicitly dealt with in several of them, would leave me even more inclined to reject (or &quot;improve and correct&quot;) the edit.  Since in fact the rest of the edit only adds up to handful of words and the question is more than a year old (and unlikely to go anywhere further), in the name of expediency I'd be most likely to go with rejection.  There is a value in rejecting an edit as it provides an opportunity to explain to someone that edits should not be used to make substantive changes, particularly if this decontextualizes the answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally I'd note that the OP has stated here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;No answers have been accepted because frankly there is no way to achieve what I want in the way I want it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course neither Thomas or Ghanima knew this (although I think it could be inferred), but it does now beg the question what the point is for anyone to waste further time with it for any reason.  The primary value of a question like this is to leave an indication for others what potential answers have been given (some of which, in this case, help to explain why there likely is no acceptable answer in a &quot;problem solved!&quot; sense) so that if they are thinking along the same lines, they can decide whether to change tack.  While parts of it may be a minor improvement, I honestly don't see much in the suggested edit which makes much different sans the substantive changes, which deserve to be rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:27.120" LastActivityDate="2016-09-01T07:50:27.313" CommentCount="0" />

I also recognize that the OP of the edited question approves the edit. However it is not up to you (Thomas Weller) or me to second guess on the original author's (EDP) intent. Which is exactly why the edit was rejected based on &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This edit deviates from the original intent of the post. Even edits that must make drastic changes should strive to preserve the goals of the post's owner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my point of view the edit was changing the tone of the post despite the good intents of the editor as outlined here in this meta post and the acceptance of the original author (provided here in hindsight). It is however noteworthy that handling of the review queues is done by such a small number of users these days and it is further never clear whether the OP of a year old question checks back in regularly. It is thus the responsibility of the users that check the queues to handle edits based on the facts they have at that time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the line of events (posting a new question, closing it as a duplicate, editing the old question) it did indeed look like you were trying to rephrase the old question to make it more like your own.

  <row Id="842" PostTypeId="1" CreationDate="2016-09-21T14:15:41.183" Score="9" ViewCount="561" Body="&lt;p&gt;A week or so ago Dmitry Grigoryev &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/839/5538&quot;&gt;brought up the problem of &lt;strong&gt;informationless answers&lt;/strong&gt; and how we deal with them&lt;/a&gt;.  This was largely inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answer&quot;&gt;a popular Stack Exchange Meta post&lt;/a&gt; from several years ago.  The reason an &quot;informationless answer&quot; might even potentially be regarded as an answer by anyone is because it contains a link to external information, so the issue is somewhat synonymous with minimal, link-only answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As per my reply there, the problem with simply deleting all such posts here is that it will do more harm than good; ideally they should be fixed, and discouraged through comments and downvoting.  This turns out to be (sort of) in keeping with a perspective &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/367/5538&quot;&gt;expressed here about 3 1/2 years ago&lt;/a&gt; by our former moderator Jivings, meaning we have (kind of) had a policy of (sometimes) tolerating these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[As of June/17 our policy includes converting these to comments.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've discussed a further experimental step we could take with Steve Robillard and Ghanima, but before explaining that, I'll summarize the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A worst case scenario link-only answer is one which, if the link is removed, contains &lt;strong&gt;literally no information&lt;/strong&gt;.  For example, the obvious:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can find an answer to your question here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one is fictional and I did not bother to include a link.  Insert it where ever you like, but observe that other than the idea an answer can be found somewhere, the actual text contains no information about anything, including the link.  To split hairs a little, I'm going to include with this answers that contain a nominal amount of infomation about the link by either:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including the literal URL text.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including a title in the link text, or referring to sections therein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicating the information from the link is &quot;helpful&quot; or &quot;can solve your problem&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since this is information that would be meaningless if the link were dead, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;These can be objectively distinguished from a &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; link-only answer such as this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You can try chroot approach using qemu-user-static from a linux vm. Here's the &lt;a href=&quot;https://wiki.debian.org/RaspberryPi/qemu-user-static&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This one is real and was posted during the last week.  It can be objectively distinguished from an informationless answer because it contains a sentence of information &lt;strong&gt;that could stand as an answer on its own&lt;/strong&gt;.  Perhaps not a very good answer, but to repeat what I've said in my reply to Dmitry and in declining certain kinds of flags, a &quot;not good&quot; answer is still an answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this light, the former case, the literal &quot;here is a link to information&quot;, is really unforgivably lazy.  There is no excuse, if you're actually able to click &quot;Post an answer&quot;, to not include a single sentence beyond, &quot;here is a link&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I do regularly do with these is convert them to comments, i.e., I don't actually decline 100% of flags against them and I largely agree with Dmitry -- just not 100%.  However, ideally, again, I think the most constructive thing that could be done is fixing them, or encouraging the original author to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So my proposal, which we would like to put to a one month trial if there are no serious objections, is to deal with them in the following way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;When such an informationless link-only answer is identified, I, Steve, or Ghanima will post a comment with a link to this Q&amp;amp;A, explaining that if no relevant information is added to the answer within 48 hours we will progress to the next step.  We will keep track of these and follow up on them with the help of our small team of gremlins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;next step&quot; is that after 48 hours if nothing is improved the answer will be converted to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/11740/what-are-community-wiki-posts&quot;&gt;Community Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  The major consequence of this is that it means anyone with 100 reputation can edit the answer without needing peer approval.  Since such answers can't get much worse, this should, hopefully, be more positive than negative.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A secondary consequence is that no one earns any points from a Community Wiki post once it is converted (points from votes prior to then, up or down, stand).  I think this takes away a sort of disincentive from cleaning up bad answers, namely, that the original author, who was too lazy to do anything themselves, may benefit from someone else's helpful activity.  This is generally bad for the site since it also means people can earn privileges here they do not deserve and should not be handed the opportunity to exercise, so all in all, this &quot;secondary consequence&quot; is appropriate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That won't necessarily apply to 100% of cases -- some link-only answers contain links so marginal they should at best be converted to comments and applying &quot;lipstick on a pig&quot; there would be silly.  However, many or most link-only answers are I think posted more out of naivete than a truly neglectful attitude, and often are appropriate and potentially helpful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rather than swooping in right away and deleting the post, this offers a positive means of informing people about our standards and giving them an opportunity to correct the problem themselves.  If not, hopefully we as a community can do it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This could be applied to brand new or old answers. So, again barring any serious objections:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you notice such posts, in addition to taking whatever action you deem appropriate within your power (downvoting, leaving a comment), please flag these &quot;for moderator attention&quot; (or as &quot;low quality&quot; or &quot;not an answer&quot; -- low quality is perhaps the best choice since I &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; that puts them in a review queue for other users, like close votes do on questions).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you are motivated to edit such answers&lt;/strong&gt;, remember, it does not have to be a major production.  It is still a substantive improvement to add a single sentence of information regarding the proposed solution &lt;em&gt;which would stand on its own as meaningful if the link were removed&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a complication with the 48 hour grace period for people who would like to correct answers but would prefer to wait until after the original author's opportunity to do so before conversion to Community Wiki has expired.  If you post the flag, you'd have to remember to come back later.  However, we've created a chat room for tracking the posts, which can also be used if you have a few free minutes and want to improve something (see &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/a/846/5538&quot;&gt;the answer below&lt;/a&gt; for more information about this). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Depending on how things play out in practice, we may decide to tweak this further by saying that the conversion will be applied if the only substantial improvements made during the 48 hour grace period &lt;em&gt;are by people other than the original author.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are tempted to post link-only answers because you are too busy for anything else but feel it is better than nothing, please read the last point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that exploiting this by making an art of posting link-only answers with a bare minimum amount of information is still not okay, and that making a habit of chain posting low quality answers is grounds for suspension.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2017-06-13T15:43:41.207" LastActivityDate="2017-06-13T15:43:41.207" Title="Cleaning up link-only answers" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;feature-request&gt;" AnswerCount="2" CommentCount="11" />

In addition to the comments we post to request editing of such link-only answers we have been implementing a new and stronger policy to aid the improvement as outlined in detail here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/842/cleaning-up-link-only-answers&quot;&gt;Cleaning up link-only answers&lt;/a&gt; The idea is to convert the answers to &lt;em&gt;community wiki&lt;/em&gt; if they're not edited and improved be the original author after a 48 hour grace period. &lt;em&gt;Community wiki&lt;/em&gt; posts can be edited by anyone with &gt;=100 reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Part of the deal is this new &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/45745/link-only-chat-room&quot;&gt;chatroom&lt;/a&gt; that tracks the reported cases.

During the past month we haven't had anyone serial posting such answers, which is where I think this mechanism will prove very effective one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To put a bit of perspective on things, we're averaging 1-2 posts per day added to the link-only chat room.  This is a mixture of both new and old posts, found through a combination of flagging and moderators catching them first hand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, as you imply, what hasn't been happening is the questions getting actively fixed (so it clearly isn't a motivator for the OP, but that's predictable considering how little effort was put in initially).  I just went back and did some from the past week, spending &amp;lt;5 min on each one that I did edit, but skipping about half of them because in my opinion they were not worth my time (e.g., links to youtube videos for solutions the OP &quot;did not try personally&quot;).  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That raises the issue of whether moderators should in &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; cases decide to just delete or (perhaps preferably) convert to comment after the 48 hours is up.  I think this is not a bad idea for things that are almost certain to remain link-only and were borderline suggestions to start with.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One thing I would definitely suggest is that we divide the chat room into two.  The &quot;first stage&quot; chat room would be the 48 hour holding pen.  Part of the reason for this is the way moderators ended up dealing with things is initially posting just a link, which in chat expands to a precis.  However, if there is anything beyond just a link in a chat post, there is no precis, and in order to track what's been dealt with after 48 hours, we've been going back and adding &quot;done&quot;.  That's expedient since you cannot insert chat posts out of chronological order, but it may be a discouragement to anyone who's in the mood to clean up posts, since from just a raw link it is hard to tell what the actual question is, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, a concern I had in the original post about this is that most people probably won't want to bother until the 48 hours is up anyway -- especially since a major reason for doing this is to allow ease of editing via the lower bar on &quot;Community Wiki&quot; posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, to sum up that suggestion, we divide the current chat room in two:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One, the 48 hour holding pen, can be moderator access only to prevent confusion, since it isn't of general interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other can be world readable.  When the conversion to Community Wiki is done, a moderator can then just delete/modify/whatever the post in the holding pen, then add a new link only post (creating a permanent precis) to the world readable &quot;Link Only Answers&quot; chat room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2016-10-23T22:56:23.487" LastActivityDate="2016-10-23T22:56:23.487" CommentCount="7" />

I really appreciate that.  In many of my posts I have learned something unexpected in the comments.  That's what I think this community is supposed to be all about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Drive-by upvotes don't worry me, but they, too, make me wish there was a comment explaining why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not in a competition with anybody - just trying to learn.  And of course with time and effort comes extra privileges.  Somehow, I doubt downvoting will be one I ever use, though.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a definite learning experience, to be sure.  I am definitely having to learn how to do my research.  Adding StackExchange into the mix is the newest part for me.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the end, my systems are humming along and will soon be communicating via TCP ports, with mated Arduinos on some to take analog readings and passing them on to the Pi3s by I2C.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately it will all end up on my hosting service just to display data on web pages that I can access from anywhere.  I should be able to exert control, also.  To get to their serverI will need to use special HTML pages containing formatted data since my hosting service won't allow me to open sockets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Might even tweet some of the raw data.  The twitter part is already set up (&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sd_solar&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/sd_solar&lt;/a&gt;) and is just waiting for me to wade through the Pi programming.  Fortunately, most all I need to do will be in Python.  And the Arduinos are easy.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is all do-able.  Just a matter of time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the record, I highly recommend the 32GB version of NOOBS.  It is worth every penny.

Since it is sort of a perennial topic, I presumed that it would be closed as a duplicate of some pre-existing question (such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/135/encouraging-people-to-explain-downvotes&quot;&gt;the one linked by Ghanima&lt;/a&gt;), and this would help to make clear that you're certainly not the only person to have felt this way, and that there are lots...and lots...and lots of discussion around addressing it already.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also used to feel that downvotes were not really a productive mechanism, and that the first downvote should require a comment.  However, I still use downvotes, so I can't deny seeing some merit in them, and while I &lt;em&gt;usually&lt;/em&gt; will leave a comment if mine is the first, I don't always.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Requiring them for every downvote would be a bit ridiculous -- it wouldn't be any different than adding &quot;great answer!&quot; for every upvote and in addition, might start to seem nasty.  Enough on that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the first one, most people aren't going to feel obliged to say anything.  With regard to the first one, probably the first comment on the &quot;migration rejected&quot; dupe is a good place to start:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Imagine this: you comment, whenever you downvote. And many times, what you get in return is abuse - people ranting at you, swearing at you, possibly downvoting all your questions/answers. Question: how quickly do you stop commenting when downvoting?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a significant point that, despite my own misgivings about downvoting etc., can be made to fit very well with what is probably &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/794/5538&quot;&gt;the core of my own philosophy regarding the ultimate purpose of similar SE mechanisms&lt;/a&gt;.  Please do read my answer there, but TLDR: the major concern is about resources.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a downvote is intended to indicate something a member of the community does not think is worthwhile (and consider Oded's second comment &quot;downvotes are for the good of the site, &lt;strong&gt;not the individual who asked&lt;/strong&gt;&quot;), then turning those into deeper drains on the limited resources of the site by requiring an accompanying debate defeats the whole purpose.  People who might otherwise be spending their time doing more positive things would end up wasting much of it with bickering, something this format, vs. traditional forums, helps to minimize.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, helping someone understand why their question/answer isn't appreciated could still be regarded as a positive activity.  But like any kind of problem solving, experience plays a big role here: People will shy away from things where they perceive an inevitable net loss, positivity wise, for their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting more specific, let's consider one of the questions I presume set this off:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/58442/5538&quot;&gt;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/q/58442/5538&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a recently deleted answer there of yours most people can't see, but we both still can...anyway, I noticed the whole thing probably the day it was first posted, and saw it evolve, but decided to stay out of it (largely because of what I've already mentioned, that I consider my time a resource which I must manage).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I agree with the points made by others there, including the downvoters, that this is not a positive contribution to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, it seems very rhetorical; you aren't really asking &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; Samba is enabled, you're stating it as fact, then you end up answering it yourself.  That's fine; quality self-answered questions are encouraged.  Unfortunately, it isn't really composed well that way.  Your answer seems more like a continuation of your question that wasn't really a question, and it's all just about proving that Samba is enabled by default on Raspbian.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, I'm pretty sure it isn't, but TBH I don't care at all (which is another reason I did not get involved) because I am positive it isn't running on any of my pis.  I don't use Samba because I have no use for Samba.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But let's presume it is, and that your original question was honestly what it &lt;em&gt;ostensibly&lt;/em&gt; is: &quot;Is it enabled, because it seems to be?&quot;.  In that case, there's a simple and definitive stepwise way to determine this:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What processes or services are required for Samba?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can it be determined if these are running?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can it be determined how they were started?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If they were started by the init system, how can we check if this is enabled by default from, e.g., an unadulterated SD card image?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, looking through the entire Q&amp;amp;A, IMO you did not attempt to tackle &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these steps.  That's fine too -- so you don't understand this.  No one understands everything, etc.  But you seem to skip straight through the whole process of trying to learn anything.  Keep in mind that part of the whole thing with the Q&amp;amp;A format, and what I mentioned before about the core of my own philosophy regarding use of resources here, is that &lt;strong&gt;it isn't hand-holding&lt;/strong&gt;.  On a traditional forum, someone might start something based on very flawed premises, then the thread takes an unexpected turn as various people point that out, and really you are into a potentially vast ball of yarn.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Not here.  A major reason that SE has been so successful is that (as I try to explain in the &quot;billionaire in a restaurant&quot; Q&amp;amp;A) the people who in reality do the most push-comes-to-shove helping probably get burned out by the vast ball of yarn and appreciate something more focused, that makes it easier for them to manage their time and maximize the positive effects.  Put another way: I know I'm long-winded, but I'm still not here to chat endlessly.  Except when I'm in chat.  Which is a separate place.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, when I see something like that, I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt;, if I were going to say anything, say your methodology is seriously flawed and leave it at that.  If you want to figure out how to do things properly, &lt;strong&gt;then you'll have to ask more questions, &lt;em&gt;separately,&lt;/em&gt; yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; This helps to create a sort of firewall against &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;HELP VAMPIRISM&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got a chuckle out of &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Cunningham&amp;#39;s_Law&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Cunningham's Law&lt;/a&gt; recently, because its something I used to exploit consciously pretty often, and in fact that's part of what got me into being what I hope and believe is an asset to the &quot;online technical help&quot; world.  Done badly, it's just passive aggressive vampirism, but done well, I think it ultimately does lead to positive results not just for you but for a larger community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How do you tell the difference? One of the barometers we have is of course:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;DOWNVOTING!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whatever your game is, if you start to notice this happening to you too much, time to take a step back and figure out why.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Figuring out why is not necessarily easy, particularly since no one is bound to explain it to you, but at least you have a clear indication that what you are doing is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being appreciated by the people around you.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the real question is probably not &quot;Why downvoting at all?&quot; but &quot;Why downvoting for this?&quot;.  I've addressed that a bit here WRT some of your recent posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the future, if you run into this problem again, ask about it here in the context of a specific post.  Doing it in the Q&amp;amp;A itself probably isn't effective or appropriate, because that's not the actual topic of the Q&amp;amp;A.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:28.777" LastActivityDate="2016-12-05T23:59:04.017" CommentCount="12" />

However, I went to the sources.list and I was surprised to find a line saying: &quot;Uncomment the following line before trying to update&quot; or similar. So when I did that I could update and install apache2 etc. without problems. I responded immediately and posted an answer.

So again, I apologize and admit my mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I sometimes watch new answers to old questions for posts from brand new users which are not answers. The most common form of this is something along the lines of &quot;I have this problem too, have you solved it yet?&quot;.  These are sometimes caught and flagged by the system or other users as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yours was not that, but it did appear at first glance to be just repeating what had been said by various other people in that Q&amp;amp;A -- and the entire Q&amp;amp;A is generally a disaster (note there are &lt;em&gt;four&lt;/em&gt; other deleted answers there most people cannot see), and that is not your fault.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm inclined to delete the entire thing as obsolete, however, the standard practice on Stack Exchange is to leave obsoleted questions and answers because people must still sometimes solve problems involving obsolete systems/software/what-have-you.  There's also the issue of fairness, since deleting a post means the author loses reputation points that he or she legitimately earned.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This issue is by nature particularly problematic for us, and is becoming more so as time goes by.  At least one or two users with editing privileges here taken it upon themselves to deal with this by adding notes where appropriate, and in fact I've followed that model and done the same thing to a few of the answers there:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note this answer is out-of-date and the current version of Raspbian is &lt;em&gt;jessie&lt;/em&gt;, not &lt;em&gt;wheezy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;  Make sure of which one you are using before you do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This seems like a reasonable solution -- thanks to Milliways, who was the first person I noticed doing this a month or so ago.

Additionally, I like neat and compact repositories. These are great things to find. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other side of myself also understands these become canonical in nature, open off topic debates about why one is better or worse because of XYZ, and need constant update as the resources change.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think keeping how the SE Q&amp;amp;A system works in mind is a determining factor here. What is the impact in allowing the question after the answer changes and are 'we' as a community going to constantly and consistently update the answer - or - do we forget duplicate questions in this specific arena (no, I wouldn't think so). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd feel better if it did close. Disappointing as it may be to many, the answers to the question are opinion based and would be very difficult work with. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'd propose handling this type of question like I try and do on Arqade when someone asks about pirated software, and that is to direct them simply to the official source to discover an endorsed list of resources, and letting that question stand, but closing all others a duplicates. It removes the answer as an opinion, and establishes the questions in the system to be searchable at any time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's just my opinion though. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58541" LastActivityDate="2017-01-14T19:00:28.340" CommentCount="1" />

I don't have time to finish them all at the moment, so I will answer them as I have time throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 1&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A question from the site has got into the Hot Network Questions, and has attracted several joke answers which have attracted quite a few votes. The answers technically solve the problem, but are clearly not serious and probably won't be very useful. &lt;strong&gt;What would you do in this situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first thing I would do is mark the question as being &quot;protected&quot;. While this certainly won't prevent all the incoming junk, it's the most logical place to start. After that I would post a reminder under the question (pinned if possible) that joke answers are off topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the answer is clearly unhelpful, I'm still hesitant to outright delete non-abusive and non-spam content. Instead, I would convert the answer to a comment, and send the user a private message explaining what was done and why.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 2&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My answer would depend greatly on what the flags are, and how many users they're coming from. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If flags are primarily provided by one or two users, it implies that there might be some bad blood between those users. In this case I'd try speaking with the user(s) who are consistently flagging the other the user and see if I can't mediate the conflict into something more reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the problem is more widespread, I would contact the individual being flagged and speak with them about the problem. Sometimes people don't realize that they have a habit of coming off as curt or that their behavior is offensive to others. If they're receptive, the problem is likely solved here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If neither of these solutions work, I would then take steps to suspend the user if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 3&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderation of this site should be a team effort. If I disagree with another moderator's decision, I will bring it up in the moderators' chat room to see if we can come to a solution we all agree on. If it comes down a one off differing opinion, I would rather leave the original decision (either mine or theirs) as is, rather than create community division.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Luckily we have more than two moderators, so there's good opportunity for back and forth when dealing with various issues.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 4&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The scope of the site is generally the result of a consensus. As a moderator, you are expected to participate and to lead that continuous definition. &lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about enforcing definitions on which you do not necesarily [sic] agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a moderator, I will do my best to guide the role of the site as best I can. I realize that I may not always agree with the rules as is, but I am willing to enforce the scope as the community defines it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, if a moderator cannot enforce the definition as is stated by their community, then that moderator should be willing to step down. StackExchange moderators do not own the site they govern.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 5&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do badges/reputation matter in retaining the interest of SE Users?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you think not, what other things might help to do so?&lt;/em&gt; If you think they do, then hypothetically if you could change it, &lt;em&gt;what is the thing that is not currently recognised/awarded but ought most to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think badges play a huge part in what keeps people interested in SE. Sure it's not the only thing, but &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;gamification&lt;/a&gt; is a big deal. I've personally found myself going beyond what I would normally participate in because I wanted to get a badge for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would like to see more badges for assisting the site as a whole. We don't always need additional answers, but edits to help flesh out answers, comments, and reviewing could all use be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 6&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Above all else, a moderator helps keep the site alive and to keep it progressing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Question 7&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

I would like to not only help with the site issues, but be involved in the processes in which community concerns are dealt with by StackExchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While I could do a lot with 10k or 20k rep, reputation gains are relatively slow, and I'd like to start helping more now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="8496" LastEditorUserId="8496" LastEditDate="2017-01-25T16:51:03.433" LastActivityDate="2017-01-25T16:51:03.433" CommentCount="0" />

The answers technically solve the problem, but are clearly not serious and probably won't be very useful. &lt;strong&gt;What would you do in this situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Firstly I have noticed that questions from this site rarely feature on the Hot Network Questions. So clearly someone has asked a really question and it should be treated as such. Alternatively the question has been asked as a bit of joke, hence it has attracted a lot of attention. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If its the first scenario, and users new to the site are posting the potentially inappropriate answers I would comment on the answers for the user to take the Tour and find out how the site should work. For answers that clearly do not answer the question I would give the user a warning and delete/edit the answer as appropriate. If its more experienced users posting answers, I would urge them to give a genuine answer to the question and to leave any joke solutions at the bottom of their answer and label it as such.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another action that should be taken if the question is generating lots of unhelpful answers from new users is to mark the question as protected. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the second scenario where the question was asked as a joke, or asked with the intention of generating joke answers. Firstly I would create a chat with the user to discuss what prompted them to ask the question and to remind them of how to act on the site. I would potentially then proceed to close the question as off-topic. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios I would also discuss with my fellow moderators what other action should be taken with regards to the question and the answers it generated.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would start by looking through what caused the flags to be raised in the first place. The chances are its a user who has lots of knowledge related to the Pi and are not responding well to any criticisms on their answers. Or are getting frustrated by other users writing comments on the answer asking for more clarity or information.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution I would take is to open a private chat with the user and firstly thank them for their contribution to the site. Its not something I think we do enough of. I would then remind them politely to stop and think before writing comments and to try and put themselves in the other person's shoes. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would then wait to see if their behavior improves if not I would look at suspending their account for a short period of time. Failing that, as a last resort I would remove the user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively if the flags have stemmed from a small group of users or a single user I would talk to them to find out what lead to them raising a number of flags against a single user. If necessary they would be banned from flagging, if that does not resolve the issue then I would take further disciplinary action. However, all of this I would discuss with my fellow moderators, so we could formulate a plan to minimize this behavior occurring again in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In such a case I would raise the issue with them and get them to lay out their reasoning for any action they took. I would also politely explain my point of view. If they then don't budge on the issue I would discuss the matter with another moderator. Ultimately if both moderators do not agree with my opinion, I would let it go. There is no point starting a massive argument over a single question.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The scope of the site is generally the result of a consensus. As a moderator, you are expected to participate and to lead that continuous definition. &lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about enforcing definitions on which you do not necesarily agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Out of a whole set of definitions there is always going to be things you do not agree about. Contrastingly, within those definitions there will always be things you do agree on. So, to that end you are still enforcing definitions you agree with, and of course I would enforce stuff I might not agree with. Although, those things if I feel the need, can be discussed with my fellow moderators to find out why those definitions exist. Opposed to blindly enforcing definitions that I do not agree with, due to possibly misunderstanding or misinterpreting them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do badges/reputation matter in retaining the interest of SE Users?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you think not, what other things might help to do so?&lt;/em&gt; If you think they do, then hypothetically if you could change it, &lt;em&gt;what is the thing that is not currently recognised/awarded but ought most to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Speaking as an SE user I get a real feel of satisfaction when I earn a new badge or open up the site to discover I have earned some reputation. Badges and reputation give users something to work towards, and with earning reputation it earns you new privileges. As the current system of badges and reputation goes I think it works quite well. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, that does not make it perfect. I personally would like to see an introduction of platinum badges which would sit above gold badges. These would be awarded for outstanding achievements. Also certain badges can be earned multiple times. I think it would be interesting, for example, once a bronze badge is earned say 10 times you receive a silver or even a gold badge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Moderators are here to keep the site functioning and to prevent the whole place from descending into chaos. Their job is to help guide new users in the right direction and to gently remind experienced users what to do if they go off-track. They also edit questions and answers as appropriate and handle posts which do not belong on the site. They are also a point of wisdom when users are unsure of something relating to the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I will be the first to admit my history isn't perfect, however I have improved greatly since I have joined the site and I always endeavor to my best. However that diamond represents a position of responsibility, of someone who leads the way. And that is always what I try to do.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Question 8&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting to 10K or 20K reputation takes a long time, and users of this site can be a bit stingy with upvotes. I of course will continue to do my best to increase my reputation. However, I have reached a point where there is a limit to what tasks I can carry out with the reputation I have. So, by becoming a moderator I will have all the other tools required to continue doing my best to help the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24296" LastEditorUserId="24296" LastEditDate="2017-01-28T19:55:23.160" LastActivityDate="2017-01-28T19:55:23.160" CommentCount="0" />

If the answers do solve the problem, jokes are fine. The vote system is designed for the best answers to flat to the top, so if the community is voting for these, then this answer is &quot;good&quot; in the community's opinion. I'm a little fuzzy on how an answer can solve the problem but not be very useful, but I do believe I've come across a few of those: I'd have to evaluate the specific answer and decide if it's an &quot;appropriate answer&quot; or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a community, there will be dissension to varying degrees about technical stuff. If the user's answers are valuable, then they are valuable, end of story. Other users are free to disagree or object or suggest their own answers, as long as everybody remains civil and respectful, this is how you foster discussion and the sense of community. I love seeing people commenting on other people's answers in order to contrast or interject. It's gotten me to refine my answers on a couple of occasions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This situation arose on another StackExchange site I'm active on, very recently. A Mod opened a question on the Meta site to discuss this, and then we talked about it some more in the chat. Initial impressions are often misleading: when I saw the questions up for closing, I initially thought the Mod was being way too harsh (the question seemed innocuous to me), but reading the Meta thread, the Mod posted links to a slew of similar questions from the same user, and after digging some more on my own, I decided for myself that this user was trolling the site. I jumped in the chat and shared my findings with the Mod and others and fully supported the Mod in his attempt to close the questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The scope of the site is generally the result of a consensus.

While there's nothing inherently wrong with editing 100 posts (as long as the edits are legit), it does show those posts as &quot;active.&quot; This can be detrimental to the site when people are gong for the &quot;archeologist&quot; badges, and all of a sudden dozens of ancient posts float up to the surface as &quot;active.&quot;&#xA;What I wold change, well, there's a few of these badges that are problematic to me (like the archeologist and the electorate), I would lobby to have them deleted.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my experience, Moderators are just experienced users that have access to site maintaining tools. They still eat pizza while one-hand-typing an answer, they just get called upon as a mediator whenever there's either a difference of opinion about something or there's something &quot;not normal&quot; and the site needs guidance on how to proceed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

If the user is &lt;em&gt;salty&lt;/em&gt; in general, or If it's conflict between users, a heart-to-heart discussion with the user(s) may alleviate the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If it seems that they're continuing the trend on purpose, restrictions on the user(s) may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;3.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quite simply, I'd ask &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;. If I'm not satisfied with the explanation, I'd arrange for a small discussion together with others or with only the two of us (openly, in the relevant chat room), depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;4.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The scope of the site is generally the result of a consensus. As a moderator, you are expected to participate and to lead that continuous definition. &lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about enforcing definitions on which you do not necesarily agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm quite loose about my opinions, and you usually won't hear me argue with another regarding the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But, if the matter at hand is clearly &lt;em&gt;bs&lt;/em&gt;, I would try to get my opinion out to the other moderators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If all of them unanimously disagree, I would be cool with it and do my duty, else I would give up my position as a moderator (with notice to prevent a vacuum). There is no point in starting a conflict.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;5.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do badges/reputation matter in retaining the interest of SE Users?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you think not, what other things might help to do so?&lt;/em&gt; If you think they do, then hypothetically if you could change it, &lt;em&gt;what is the thing that is not currently recognised/awarded but ought most to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course they do, more or less. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let's be real here for a second. Based on my observation, a part, &lt;em&gt;but not all&lt;/em&gt;, do try to get on top of the game. Some are in it for the reputation points, others are about badges, some are both, but what really catches my eye is that &lt;em&gt;a significant part&lt;/em&gt; of SE users don't care about those &lt;strong&gt;at all&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Users, based on my observation, are more keen about &lt;em&gt;getting their questions answered&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All in all, content quality looks like the primary factor that makes users stay. That's where the moderators, and concerned citizens, come into play.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Content creators&quot; (those who answer more than ask), on the other hand, seem to be the ones most concerned about badges/reputation. In the current state, I wouldn't really change anything since the &quot;game&quot; is already pretty balanced. It's already giving out rewards to relevant actions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;6.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The least amount of work possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That means managing the community in such a way that causes the least disruption, or dissipates disruption quickly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This also means keeping the site alive and developing since a healthy community tends to self-regulate, minimizing load on the moderators.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;7.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

The answers technically solve the problem, but are clearly not serious and probably won't be very useful. &lt;strong&gt;What would you do in this situation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I quite enjoy &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/184618/what-is-the-best-comment-in-source-code-you-have-ever-encountered&quot;&gt;some of the more legendary StackOverflow threads&lt;/a&gt;, but they do have a tendency towards closure. I think they're not necessarily harmful for the site provided as long as everyone plays nice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My goal here would be to make sure that whoever asked the question has the opportunity to see it answered. Given that several answers are already available I would inform the user that the question stands a reasonable chance of closure, giving them the chance to choose the best of a fairly bad bunch. The question should be marked as protected at the same time, restricting further answers to people who have at least a passing familiarity with the site. Following that, outright garbage answers should be deleted or converted to comments, and anything which is a reasonable attempt at an answer stays where it is. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you deal with a user who produced a steady stream of valuable answers, but tends to generate a large number of arguments/flags from comments?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;StackExchange has several &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; valuable users who are well known for their unique conversational style, and I've noticed a few names creeping up the ranks on the Pi board who are a little terser than others. I'm a great believer in the site's &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/be-nice&quot;&gt;'be nice'&lt;/a&gt; guidelines. If someone is consistently and needlessly aggressive, rude, or otherwise unpleasant to their fellow users then there's a real risk of long term damage to the board's user base, particularly here where we have so many young and/or inexperienced users. I would begin by contacting the individual privately for a reasonable chat about their lack of civility. If we fail to reach an amicable understanding, or the behaviour continues, then I'd consult with my fellow moderators to make sure we're all in agreement before taking steps to restrict or suspend the user. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With the decline in traditional farming practices rendering it impractical to source decent mobs with pitchforks these days, I think I'd have to settle for a good chat and possibly a round of rock/paper/scissors. The problems we solve here are generally quite small problems in the grand scheme of things, and aren't worth the potential fallout of a mod war. I'd present my case as best I can, take a consensus among the group, then move swiftly onwards. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;The scope of the site is generally the result of a consensus. As a moderator, you are expected to participate and to lead that continuous definition. &lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about enforcing definitions on which you do not necesarily agree?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extremely relaxed. If I were selected as a moderator I'd be working in a group of 3 presumably reasonable people with a decent understanding of the board and its general direction. If that group, hopefully after some community engagement on &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;, decides that things are not going to go my way on this occasion then I have to presume that they know what they're about and go with the flow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do badges/reputation matter in retaining the interest of SE Users?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;If you think not, what other things might help to do so?&lt;/em&gt; If you think they do, then hypothetically if you could change it, &lt;em&gt;what is the thing that is not currently recognised/awarded but ought most to be?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yes.&lt;/em&gt; I don't think there's any way you could argue that the people who come back often aren't, at some point in their SE careers, motivated at least a little bit by the points. I, personally, &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; my wee heap of imaginary internet points, and still occasionally have a daft hour or two chasing an elusive badge. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to what I'd change, I'd like to reward at least early-stage up voting. On any given day you can scroll all the way down the front page and see half a dozen serviceable questions with no up votes. It might be nice to incorporate a new badge for your 100th up vote, or something a little more complex like a badge for your 10th up vote on a first answer that was selected as the correct answer. Something which encourages passing users to engage a little more with material outwith their own Q&amp;amp;As. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ideally nothing. Moderators are the board's nuclear option, and should make use of the mod tools as little as possible. They should encourage the community to keep doing the things it does well, provide a good example to other users and do what they can to keep the peace. If &lt;em&gt;absolutely necessary&lt;/em&gt;, mods should be confident enough in their understanding of SE and this board that they can make effective interventions - suspending users, escalating issues to SE staff, etc. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well I was fine until I read this question. Now my inner hamster wheels are spinning furiously trying to figure out which over-tired 2am answer I'm going to get called out on first. If I were selected as a moderator I hope I'd continue to contribute to the site as best I can, ignoring the addition of the diamond in all but exceptional circumstances. If you need to invoke your status as a mod to win an argument you've already lost it. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Mods carry a little more responsibility for the nuts-and-bolts operation of the site than your average high-scoring user, and perhaps a little more input into its capabilities. Further to that, they can deal directly with the (thankfully rare) incidents of spam and unwanted user behaviour, and can serve more effectively as mediators during bunfights. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32756" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-05-23T12:37:05.477" LastActivityDate="2017-01-30T17:22:28.640" CommentCount="0" />

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;demonstrations of interesting machines using Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/893&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="168" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-03-16T15:50:49.097" LastActivityDate="2017-10-16T23:54:01.313" Title="Community Promotion Ads - 2017" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;" AnswerCount="7" CommentCount="1" />

Tags are created when added to a question (i.e., there are no tags with no questions), and the way synonyms work is if you, e.g., try now to add &lt;code&gt;frequency&lt;/code&gt; you will automagically get &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/measuring&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;measuring&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;measuring&lt;/a&gt; and have to decide if that is appropriate.  I think this works as the non-measuring type questions were the ones with the most obvious more appropriate existing tags (clocking, audio, or RF related).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note there's no way to actually blacklist a non-existent potential tag, other than making it a synonym.  I did at some point try to create a &lt;code&gt;pointless&lt;/code&gt; tag to which certain synonyms can be mapped, but this doesn't work as it would require at least one question tagged &lt;code&gt;pointless&lt;/code&gt;...'nuff said ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally I check the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/tags?tab=new&quot;&gt;new tags&lt;/a&gt; page to catch things like this but alas, not often enough (and sometimes my powers of foresight fail to see how something is likely spurious).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="-1" LastEditDate="2017-04-13T12:56:28.777" LastActivityDate="2017-02-24T10:05:04.890" CommentCount="0" />

So much so, that people that don't normally fall into the category themselves are learning about them.

As it turns out I declined one of those flags a while ago...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let me clarify my reasoning behind this and come to an understanding why that reasoning breaks apart upon discussing it: personally I tend to read &quot;not constructive&quot; with a strong negative connoation (just like the MSE questions you've linked states), as in &quot;mean-hearted&quot; but just not as mean as to warrant a &quot;rude or offensive&quot; flag. I would have flagged the examples you've listed as &quot;too chatty&quot; not as &quot;not constructive&quot;. Which is by the way what you suggested in your question too: &lt;em&gt;Whenever I come across posts with too chatty comments, I normally flag them (I've been doing so on other sites too).&lt;/em&gt; See also: &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/244225/284388&quot;&gt;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/244225/284388&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It's only important if it fails to convey why the comment should be deleted; for example I'm likely to dismiss a “rude or offensive” comment on something that isn't rude, even if it would warrant deletion for some other reason that's only apparent in context.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is, however, that comment flags are all treated the same when handled, i.e. there is no penalty for the poster of the comment, it is either deleted or not and that is that. So there is no harm done deleting a comment that is flagged with a &quot;wrong&quot; reason. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that the comments don't follow the basic rule (&lt;em&gt;comments should be used to request clarification from the author&lt;/em&gt;) that should warrant deletion, true.

However, I do not think it is a very serious concern (the way, e.g., abusive language is).  By analogy, traffic cops do not stop everyone observed doing 90 kmh in an 80 kmh zone (but hopefully they do go always go after people who run red lights).  Extending that, if a hypothetical citizen were observing a cop at a speed trap and said, &quot;That person was doing 92 in an 80 zone!&quot;, I do not think this compels the officer to begin a chase, etc.  I believe generally it is recognised that the police can exercise their discretion in making arrests, handing out tickets, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Keeping the analogy rolling, hopefully part of what informs the &quot;discretion&quot; of a police officer is his or her experience doing that job all the time -- a greater than average awareness of the big picture with regard to crime or traffic behaviour in a given area.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we had a lot of gratuitous &quot;thank you&quot; comments going on, or a particular individual who did it habitually, I would take the job of enforcing the policy more seriously.

C++ has undergone a lot of evolution in the last decade, earning it a range of tags on Stack Overflow, and likewise Java versions include nuaces and depreciations, such that it has version specific tags there.  These are unlike python in that they try to maintain a very high degree of backward compatibility.  Perl, however, is the same in that perl 6 is not backward compatible with 5 or 4 etc.  I imagine every language has one distinction or the other with major versions, and there may even be significant differences in the API with minor versions (there are corresponding examples of minor version tagging on S.O., e.g. &lt;code&gt;lua-5.x&lt;/code&gt;).  But I do not think it is worthwhile for us &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; to have multiple perl or C++ or java tags.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the only serious candidate is python, and what I would suggest, if someone at some point wants to start doing this, is that &lt;code&gt;python-2&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;python-3&lt;/code&gt; be &lt;em&gt;supplemental&lt;/em&gt; and not replacements for &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which then begs the question to what they should be applied, and this is where I'd argue it may be a nuance that's still unnecessary here, since ideally I think they should apply to questions that are specifically and explicitly questions about API differences across versions, which are questions that belong on S.O. period.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, I might have used &lt;code&gt;C++11&lt;/code&gt; on S.O. questions without said idealism at work simply because I used some C++11 idiom.

There's some expectation that they have a minimal degree of competence in order to be asking a pi specific question.  Occasionally it is really clear when someone doesn't (can't use conditionals/loops properly, etc.) and hopefully either those get a quick answer or else they are closed as off-topic.

It also seems to me the classification is one cooked up by the system in certain circumstances, i.e., it is not because a moderator ticked &quot;dispute&quot; (there's no such option). Based on that Meta.SE post and the other one linked at the end, here's what I think happened:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;You flagged NAA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Minutes later, the system flagged VLQ (very low quality).

I think it is reasonable to discuss it again to determine how the community thinks of this now and how we agree to handle it. Maybe it's time to reconsider how we apply our own standard and make the helpcenter reflect the practise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This ist the most recent discussion on the topic (early 2016): &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/719/19949&quot;&gt;What defines the borders between RPi and other related Stack Exchange sites?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally I used to go with: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;When in doubt, ask &lt;strong&gt;there&lt;/strong&gt; first. Questions where the Raspberry Pi is not a significant factor will likely be closed. [emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However as a moderator I &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; to not hammer things down without a few votes by the community (sometimes I still do if I feel it is the right thing to do or if the question is blatantly off-topic). So usually votes need to be carried by community - that is, five voting members to agree an a certain position. So as Goldilocks' has put it in his answer to the meta question linked above: &quot;this depends of the willingness and availability of participants&quot; and might take some time. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;While we need questions to be at least a little specific to the RPi Milliways has brought up an important point (again in the discussion linked above): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;I agree, although pragmatism sometimes prevails. If a new user asks a 'NIX question I will often answer, because the questioner is often new to LInux and the Pi is the first and only experience. Besides Unix &amp;amp; Linux (Operating systems) can be intimidating. Users there don't seem to understand absolute beginners and confuse them with technicalities.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is usually fine if a question receives a helpful answer at our site. If it does not however, one might still consider asking at the larger and more general sites such as SO or U&amp;amp;L. Note that migration of such questions is not always the best approach. Usually hinting to ask alsewhere while closing a question here works better if the question need some polishing to work well on another branch of StackExchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have experienced that most users of our community tend to give quite some leeway to questions of users that are new to the Raspberry Pi and/or StackExchange... and again if the question does not blatantly violate the scope of our site &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; the respective user gets a helpful answer here we could call it &lt;em&gt;mission accomplished&lt;/em&gt;. Given time and a few guiding comments one could still point out the nuances of the workings of StackExchange and how and where to post additional questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The openCV question that you have linked however is an example of how it's not done well. It is technically completely unrelated to the Pi and a solution that would perform well on any other Linux board is likely to do the trick on the Pi too. The question received just one short answer and one could very well argue that the significantly larger user base on SO could have been beneficial to better answers (or impromptu close as a duplicate).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closing it now however will change little as it will still persist on our site (question with answer). It is also too old to migrate away. The only good that it would do is a sort of setting a precedence here... but I think this is done better discussing the issue here on meta and handling new questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19949" LastActivityDate="2017-08-07T23:04:09.447" CommentCount="9" />

There's nothing apparently special about this instantiation of SE that makes the issues raised in the question different than any other instantiation of SE.  In all of them, for example, if you delete you lose the information that's at the link.  The underlying reason for this policy is that the links typically go dead over time anyway, so there is no archival value and the Q&amp;amp;A gets mucked up with non-response answers over time.  Going back to clear those out later - even as &quot;Community Wiki&quot; - is just kicking the can down the road.  It's probably kicking it so far down the road that it never gets cleaned up.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I suggest that these should be handled as on other SE sites - Flagged and then deleted.  It allows someone else who thinks there's some merit to the information at the link to post a &quot;high quality&quot; answer that includes the link.  Editing very low-quality posts should also be discouraged so as not to reward people making such posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In light of the comments, I'm adding a screen capture of what you get in the very low quality review queue for those following along who may not have seen a VLQ instance in the process of getting deleted. Note the comment on this one that has one vote to be deleted.  The message was populated when the first person chose a reason for deleting and is visible to the person who posted.  That comment will get up-votes as additional people vote to delete it.  Just to point out that the &lt;em&gt;normal review process already has feedback built-in&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's also nothing to stop someone from responding to that feedback and improving the answer before or after it is deleted.  Even on SO where these sometimes get reviewed quickly, I sometimes get a response from the author on these through the comments, so it's definitely possible.  Even more so on a small site like this where it will take a while for enough people to review to cause the deletion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there's nothing to stop you from adding an additional comment at the time with a more custom suggestion.

I suspect many of these users haven't been active in months, and far fewer actually visit the site on a day-to-day basis. Even fewer actively contribute to review.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Many review tasks spread across few reviewers leads to the situation we have now, where dedicated users like you have to handle an awful lot by yourself (&lt;em&gt;thank you for doing that, by the way!&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/1PxBE.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;So many systems&lt;/a&gt; rely on review working, and we need more people to share the load.

Generally, moderators only use their binding votes on blatantly inappropriate posts, and &lt;strong&gt;that's a good thing&lt;/strong&gt;, because ideally users should be able to decide what to close democratically. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In reality, there are probably less than 10 users who actively are able to close questions, which makes it much harder to close questions in a timely fashion and give the authors feedback on how to improve their question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what can we do?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, we need &lt;strong&gt;more reviewers&lt;/strong&gt;, and to figure out why people don't review. Is it simply because we need more users here? Are the users here who can review choosing not to? Can we incentivise reviewing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don't feel like loading &lt;em&gt;more reviews&lt;/em&gt; on to the users who are doing this already is sustainable.

Superuser is is less common and is more or less on a par with Arduino, Robotics, and Hardware Recommendations. IoT has been a target three times lately.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is however noteworthy that migration really is not something that happens very often. To give an impression: the last five migrations (away) have been on: May 18, May 22, July 10, August 1, September 9. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I understand it there is no tool for community or moderators to set those migration paths up. Instead we would need to reach out for the community managers to implement it. Which they do only if necessary, read: &quot;when the frequency of migration is creating a burden for the source site&quot; (stolen from &lt;a href=&quot;https://gamedev.meta.stackexchange.com/a/2373/90591&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). That's not the case here too given the number of migrations as shown above. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Concerning migrations it is noteworthy that (same source): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Generally we only migrate a question when it's well-formed but blatantly off-topic here, and also blatantly on-topic somewhere else. If it's a junk question it gets closed, if it's on-topic here, it doesn't matter if it's on-topic somewhere else too. It stays here (especially if it's been answered).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, where to go from that? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use comments to guide the OP of the respective question, i.e. suggesting to post someplace else if you have reason to believe that question is a good fit for the other site. (Here it is necessary to remember that questions can very well be on topic on more than one site, if it is on topic here, no need to send it away.) This (in theory) includes that the OP checks the target site for any dupes to their question first (being shot down upon arrival is the sad fate of many migrations). Obviously the original post needs to be closed (close vote or flag) here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;(if 1. does not work) Moderators can migrate posts away to any site. So if the post is well above the &quot;crap&quot; threshold, feel free to flag for moderator attention and explain why you think it should be migrated and where to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="19949" LastActivityDate="2017-09-18T15:20:20.367" CommentCount="3" />

The &lt;em&gt;average&lt;/em&gt; score is probably higher, but that is because when something is appreciated, it can quickly be appreciated by hundreds &lt;em&gt;or thousands&lt;/em&gt; of people.  As you and others have observed, we don't have the membership to do that -- yet we are still saddled with the one-size-fits-all S.E. system; you need the same rep to earn privileges here as you do on sites that are orders of magnitude larger.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the answers already here do sum it up, albeit some of the bitter ones represent a subjective consequence; people get hung up on the rep thing, feel frustrated, and give up (which may or may not be for the greater good). If your goal is points, this is definitely the wrong exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've berated people about the importance of voting before, to no avail.  Something that distinguishes us from many other small sites is the very technical nature, and (despite the intention of trying to keep it narrow), the very broad realm.  To upvote something you at least have to read it, and most members probably aren't going to read most posts.  On less technical, more focussed sites, the general readership is liable to be more engaged, and therefore more likely to cast votes.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we do have, which I think is a major part of why we graduated from beta, is a lot of &lt;em&gt;page views&lt;/em&gt;.  This is obviously important to the system as a whole, because part of what allows it to be free to use are advertising revenues.  Someone without enough rep to vote, or without any account at all, will influence that stat the same way 10k+ users do.  This is significant not just in terms of revenue, but because it implies people do actually find help here, even if they do not sign up to add &quot;Thanks!&quot; (which is of course discouraged as superfluous).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So again, if what you are chasing is rep, this is the wrong place.

The &quot;Be Nice&quot; policy is implemented very differently on different sites of the Stack Exchange network, let each site decide on what angle they want to take.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Talk to the user. Stack Exchange is 100% typed, and it can be easy to read way too much into tone and intent, just as it can be easy to overlook the tone and intent that is coming out of our fingers. Talk to the user, make them realise the concerns that are arising from their comments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Our community is struggling to maintain higher level users over time.

The Raspberry Pi platform attracts different crowds, from hobbyists to IT professionals, to laypeople who have a cool idea but don't know how to get it realised. Some hobbyists and IT professionals will naturally stop coming when their interest in the RPi dies off. They are an important resource for this community, and as long as they feel welcome and their input appreciated, they may drop by from time to time and still be semi-active.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Over time there have been a few meta questions related to including other-fruited-pis, such as this one that mentioned banana pi: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/520/can-we-ask-questions-related-to-banana-pi-here&quot;&gt;Can we ask questions related to banana pi here?&lt;/a&gt; With some quick search you can also find similar questions about orange pi.

Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every single site on the Stack Exchange faces a similar question once it reaches a certain size: there are questions that (because of the community's expertise) best belong on their site, but unfortunately there's a rule somewhere that could be construed as saying &quot;NO!&quot; We have 2 options:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Start a new StackExchange site for those questions, with all the growing pains and tiny community that it entails and banish those questions from this site.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Expand the guidelines of this site to include those questions that fall under the existing skill set and expertise of the community, and perhaps rename the site to reflect this.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple example to this is the &quot;mechanics&quot; Stack Exchange was renamed to &quot;Motor Vehicle Maintenance and Repair&quot; in order to expand the scope to DIY and enthusiasts, which is most of the community's focus now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would PM them and talk about it. There may be more to the question or user than meets the eye. Such an issue occurred on another site of the Stack Exchange network where I am active, basically the site was getting trolled by questions that on the surface seemed legitimate and innocent, but the pattern of questions coming from the same user made it more look like they were trolling the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;This site has experimented with &quot;policies&quot; that &lt;em&gt;arguably&lt;/em&gt; run counter to the process and experience expected from the larger SE universe.  There was some discussion of that, for example, on these two questions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/970/is-converting-link-only-answers-to-community-wiki-working&quot;&gt;Is converting link-only answers to Community Wiki working?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/963/how-related-to-raspberry-pi-must-a-question-be&quot;&gt;How related to Raspberry Pi must a question be?&lt;/a&gt;.

If you argue for following norms from larger SE sites, how would your respond to the arguments in the meta questions listed that the small size and diverse subject matter encountered on this site require a different approach?  If you argue for &quot;customizing&quot; on this site, how would you choose what fits and mitigate any potential learning curve on high-quality users used to other SE sites who might occasionally contribute here?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each site on the StackExchange network has it's own personality ranging form a unique take on the &quot;Be nice&quot; policy, to some having &quot;custom&quot; policies. The StackExchange network was never meant to be a collection of cookie-cutter topic-specific sites, it was meant to be a platform to exchange knowledge in Q&amp;amp;A form. As long as we continue to follow the spirit of the StackExchange network, I think we'll be fine, we just need to not go overboard with the custom policies.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Regarding the specific example in the question, I'm on the fence about link-only answers:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's annoying to summarise the content found on another site when that site would take the OP by the hand and walk them through their solution.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's even more annoying when your Google search bring up a really old answer to a really old question and the link doesn't work or the information isn't there.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think converting a link-only answer to a Community Wiki is a good approach. The OP shouldn't be getting rep changes from other people fixing and improving their link-only answer, and at the same time, we are getting a quality answer. If the community feels this is the way forward, then experienced users from other sites of the Stack Exchange network will need to add that to their learning curve. Each site of the Stack Exchange network is a little bit different, and IT-related questions often have their answer change over time when an OS or software gets a new revision, making link-only answers highly problematic as the information at the other end may be volatile.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you respond to a user that attacked you personally for actions you take as a moderator (e.g. deleting or closing their posts).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a regular user, I have voted to close or delete posts countless times, and my name shows up (&quot;put on hold by:&quot;). Nobody has ever attacked me for that in the past, I don't see how being a moderator would be any different. But if they do, I would explain to them how to improve their post so it gets undeleted or reopened.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I know for a fact that moderators sit around and drink Red Bull while browsing the site 25 hours per day. lol Each moderator takes his or her role and responsibilities slightly differently, some take a step back from answering questions in order to allow other users to participate, some remain as active as they were in their pre-mod days, some focus exclusively on policing the site, some just deal with issues as they come up. We need mods, and if the team of mods has non-overlapping interests and philosophy, we will get better coverage and better behind-the-scenes discussions between them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments.

Can I have two??? And can I pick the colour??? lol Diamond-schmiamond. I say what I say and I do what I do. Diamond or no diamond, people are free to read as much or as little into posts as they please. The only thing I would be more careful about is anything related to site policy. A mod isn't the law, he or she just keeps things running smoothly for the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Getting more rep doesn't make me more effective, it just means I've been busier with up-voted questions and answers, which will invariantly be limited to my sphere of knowledge. Keeping the site clean and keeping discussions on track and on topic helps the entire community, beyond my sphere of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="46969" LastEditorUserId="46969" LastEditDate="2017-11-07T04:19:38.090" LastActivityDate="2017-11-07T04:19:38.090" CommentCount="2" />
  <row Id="1005" PostTypeId="2" ParentId="1002" CreationDate="2017-11-09T20:32:18.647" Score="7" Body="&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you answer this &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/961/senior-member-continuously-mildly-abusive-towards-newbies&quot;&gt;question&lt;/a&gt; regarding the negative actions of a high reputation user, which was posted to raspberrypi.meta earlier this year? Complete answers should address not only the concerns of the OP, but the behavior in question and the concerns raised in the comments. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its certainly very unfortunate this occurred, especially since active high rep users are a rarity on the site so are an invaluable resource.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said any negative action towards any member of the community is always completely unacceptable. As a community we should be welcoming (as well as firm but fair), in our approach to users, especially new users. Yes they may not being using certain aspects of the site correctly, but that's not an excuse to give them a hard time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The correct action is to always gently point them in the right direction. Whether that's encouraging them to take the Tour or look through the FAQ. If someone new to the site gets a really bad experience, its fairly unlikely they will return. This is a problem because it will stifle the growth of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to how to deal with the offending user in question, opening up a private chat with the other mods and the user to discuss their poor behavior would be the starting point. From there I think it would be necessary to keep an eye on their posts to make sure they are not slipping into bad habits again.&#xA;I have also heard of mods sending emails to users for serious matters and that along with a temporary ban from the site would also be an option to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The concerns raised in the comments are well founded, I think some examples of the sorts of posts this high rep user where posting could have been useful to include in the discussion. It would make it easier for the community to catch such posts in the future if they knew the sort of things they should be looking out for. But I'm against publicly naming and shaming the user, that's something I feel is unnecessary. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also disagree with the idea that flagging the inappropriate comments would not be effective. I regularly flag posts and my flags are dealt with in a timely manner 9 times out of 10. I've also raised lots of concerns in the past on the Meta site and I've always got exceptional answers, which is a testament to our community. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Our community is struggling to maintain higher level users over time. Why do you think this is? Do you have any ideas on how that might be fixed?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not sure if I'm going to be popular for saying this, but its my gut feeling on the matter. I think the biggest issue with maintaining high level users is people on this site can be a little bit stingy when it comes to voting. I've personally also found from answering new user's questions that once they've got an answer they won't stick around long enough to mark it as correct. This is a problem because each accept is worth 15 rep, so losing out on lots of accepts on answers starts to hurt in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Based on my experience of being heavily active on the site over the summer I can see why high level users get bored of the site and become less active. It can become a real chore sometimes to work through posts in review queues, In fact its an issue I raised on &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/976/are-we-facing-a-problem-with-handling-the-first-posts-review-queue&quot;&gt;Meta&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've also noticed that we seem to get fewer really interesting questions that end up being a hot question on the network. I think the last question to achieve that was about a soil moisture sensor. If we don't get enough questions that are fun to answer then people will lose interest.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to how to fix that problem, that's tough. Since it can be really difficult to earn rep on the site we need to be encouraging users to vote more and also accept answers to their questions, (where appropriate). Getting the high rep users to stick around is an even harder task. Ideas I have include introducing new badges so they've always got something to work towards. I think occasionally dropping them an email with some questions they might find interesting could work as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Over time there have been a few meta questions related to including other-fruited-pis, such as this one that mentioned banana pi: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/520/can-we-ask-questions-related-to-banana-pi-here&quot;&gt;Can we ask questions related to banana pi here?&lt;/a&gt; With some quick search you can also find similar questions about orange pi. The historical answer has been that these are &lt;em&gt;and should be&lt;/em&gt; off-topic here.  Do you support continuing that position?  Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having a site exclusively about Raspberry Pi's is fairly niche, especially given the scope of some of the sites on SE. Now imagine how niche a site about the banana pi or orange pi would be. I think it seems somewhat ridiculous that those should exist as separate sites. The problem is the user base for those devices is so small that they would have a hard time keeping an SE site going.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand if we widened the scope to include those devices do we actually have any active users with the required knowledge? The demographic of our site is lots of fairly low rep users asking questions which are answered by a very small number of users. I'm not sure we have enough knowledgeable people to make that work if we widen the scope of the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it then brings into question where we draw the line, at what point is the scope of the site to wide? If orange pi's and banana pi's become on-topic, does that mean every single one of those types of devices also becomes on-topic?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If widening the scope of the site to include such devices is something that enough users are happy with I don't see the issue with having some kind of trial period to see how it works out.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would open up a chat with that mod, and possibly the other mods as well and discuss the matter. The aim of the discussion would be to come to some kind of consensus and make sure everyone is happy and understands any final decision we make.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;This site has experimented with &quot;policies&quot; that &lt;em&gt;arguably&lt;/em&gt; run counter to the process and experience expected from the larger SE universe.  There was some discussion of that, for example, on these two questions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/970/is-converting-link-only-answers-to-community-wiki-working&quot;&gt;Is converting link-only answers to Community Wiki working?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/963/how-related-to-raspberry-pi-must-a-question-be&quot;&gt;How related to Raspberry Pi must a question be?&lt;/a&gt;. What are your thoughts on how closely this site should follow the norms of other SE sites versus developing its own norms that attempt to respect its size and audience.  If you argue for following norms from larger SE sites, how would your respond to the arguments in the meta questions listed that the small size and diverse subject matter encountered on this site require a different approach?  If you argue for &quot;customizing&quot; on this site, how would you choose what fits and mitigate any potential learning curve on high-quality users used to other SE sites who might occasionally contribute here?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't see any reason why we should have to follow all of the norms of the SE network. We are a fairly unique site and what works for everyone else might not work for us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With regards to the converting link only answers to Wiki, yes I don't think that was particularly successful. Possibly due to the amount of effort required to properly produce the answer and then not really gaining much from that. Although I'm not sure I particularly like the current approach of simply deleting the answer. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to how far we diverge from the norms of SE, I don't think going to far is sensible. Having high rep users from other SE sites on here would be great to see. Including extra detail about how we run things a little differently in the FAQ or Tour would hopefully reduce any learning curve. There is of course also the Meta site and the chatrooms to seek clarification on things. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to how on topic a question about the Raspberry Pi must be? I have found that a difficult thing to gauge when reviewing posts. The problem boils down to; does this fit on Electrical Engineering, StackOverflow or Arduino? If no this is probably the suitable site for it. Of course the rules about no questions about shopping advice, e.t.c... Still apply.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you respond to a user that attacked you personally for actions you take as a moderator (e.g. deleting or closing their posts).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could understand receiving backlash for taking such actions. Although, I would open up a chat with the user and possibly another mod as a second opinion. I would proceed to outline my reasoning for taking such action and hopefully get them to a point where they understand my decision. I could have course made a mistake and it gives the user an opportunity to explain why they think I made the wrong call. This seems like a fair way of dealing with this.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To give you an example of this sort of approach being used, one user recently posted on Meta asking why their question had been closed. I'm really pleased they did this as its the correct sort of response to a decision you disagree with. You can see the post and my response &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1000/clarification-about-closed-question&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The question does not specify what sort of action this hypothetical user took in anger but I think its a point worth addressing. As well as discussing why I took the action on their post I did, I would also remind them to behave nicely on the site. Pointing out the correct way to deal with the problem is to open a chat with a mod or posting a question on Meta is something I would suggest they do next time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a perfect world we would not need moderators and everyone would just get along without a problem. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is not the case and occasionally a user with some extra abilities is required to step in and resolve the issue. Mods should ideally do as little as possible on the site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Their role should be to point users in the right direction, help users understand how the site works and deal with the occasional serious matters.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given the limited number of high rep users on the site its also important they are active in review queues, (though not too active). As well as other less exciting things like editing posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;8&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;A diamond will be attached to everything you say and have said in the past, including questions, answers and comments. Everything you will do will be seen under a different light. How do you feel about that?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I feel like I've come a really long way in the past 3 years, and I definitely feel like the quality of my posts has improved. Every now and then I do go back and edit some of my older stuff to improve it, but for the most part I'm fairly happy with my posts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think its also useful that users could see that I have transitioned from a newbie on the site up to high ranking member of the community. It shows that progression on the site is possible and everyone has to start somewhere. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;9&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In what way do you feel that being a moderator will make you more effective as opposed to simply reaching 10k or 20k rep?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I made a calculation during the summer that at the rate I was earning rep it would take up to 2 years to reach such levels of reputation. And that was when I was answering multiple questions a day. I don't have the luxury of lots of spare time now to do that, and I think focusing my efforts on the moderator side of things is more important anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Therefore, being a mod would allow me to gain the extra tools I would get at 10k and 20k rep to continue helping the site along. In addition to this being a mod also gives access to an exclusive extra set of tools. Furthermore, having the diamond attached to all of your posts gives them extra weight and users will take you that little bit more seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24296" LastEditorUserId="24296" LastEditDate="2017-11-10T12:06:58.287" LastActivityDate="2017-11-10T12:06:58.287" CommentCount="2" />

However, I didn't find any other info.  I decided to ask about it here.  I'm somewhat active on several SE's (and have read a lot of meta), and my question seemed to fit a Q&amp;amp;A format, so &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/74993/is-the-poepi-available?noredirect=1#comment118105_74993&quot;&gt;I asked&lt;/a&gt; if it was a thing yet and if it was for sale or still in development.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now it's closed as a shopping question.  Shopping?  Uh, what?  OK, let's run down the op-topic topics:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If your question is about:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[Y] Raspberry Pi hardware, including GPIO and other related electronics.&#xA;[Y] Raspberry Pi peripherals.&#xA;[N] Software specific to the Raspberry Pi.&#xA;[N] Operating Systems built for the Raspberry Pi.&#xA;[N] Materials published or provided by the Raspberry Pi Foundation.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;… then you’re in the right place to ask your question! But please note&#xA;  that the following is off topic&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[N] Raspberry Pi orders or delivery.&#xA;[N] Asking for specific purchasing recommendations.&#xA;[N] Asking for references to online material (use a search engine, and if that does not work, ask about the issue directly).&#xA;[N] Raspberry Pi accessories relating exclusively to appearance (such as cases).&#xA;[N] Questions directly related to Linux/Unix issues. Please use the Unix &amp;amp; Linux Exchange.&#xA;[N] General programming questions, e.g., &quot;How do I implement a keyboard interrupt in python?&quot;. These will be better off on Software&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Engineering or Stack Overflow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;OK, so looking at the above, I have a few things indicating on-topic, and nothing off topic.  Let's check meta for what a &quot;shopping&quot; question is defined as.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No results on this meta, but eventually I found a meta SE post &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/158809/why-are-shopping-list-questions-bad&quot;&gt;Why are &amp;quot;shopping list&amp;quot; questions bad?&lt;/a&gt; which links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.blog/2010/11/23/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/&quot;&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The meta post covers some concrete questions that identify shopping questions.  My question asks none of these.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price-shopping &amp;amp; Product recommendation questions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the best and cheapest Product of Type at this very moment?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What is the best Product of Type?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What are all the Products of Type?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;please make a subjective decision for me and explain it&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&quot;please list all my possibilities with their strengths and weaknesses&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The blog post explains how shopping questions ask answerers to do a lot of work with very little info, and make a bunch of guesses on infinitely subjective criteria.  Pretty straightforward explanation why they're not a good fit for the site.  My question doesn't do any of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How is my question a &quot;shopping&quot; question?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've made some preliminary edits; do those make it more or less of a &quot;shopping&quot; question? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="32392" LastActivityDate="2017-11-10T13:48:49.633" Title="Question is on hold for being &quot;shopping&quot;?"

That's a &quot;specific purchasing recommendation&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In terms of justifying why there is this rule and how it clearly applies to your question, let's consider a point made in the blog post, and re-iterated in the accepted answer to the MetaSE question:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;technology moves so rapidly that the best shopping recommendations will be utterly obsolete within a year!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that is true, then it certainly includes a question about where I can buy something.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Personally, that's not my biggest objection (and I'll admit, I used to have misgivings about the shopping restriction -- but I'll come back to that).  Here are the two remaining bullet points from the Meta answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are open-ended; there is never one perfect answer to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tend to attract a lot of spam and/or link only answers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can't hand you an example of this, since we haven't allowed it to happen, but very obviously, if your question were allowed to stand, and (let's pretend) this product is one which in the near future is going to expand further into the marketplace&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;.  At that point, more distributors are going to pick it up, and if (let's pretend some more), if those distributors knew that &lt;strong&gt;the Stack Exchange network was a great place for them to place free ads,&lt;/strong&gt; your question would gradually attract more and more answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Yes sir! You can buy this fine widget at Foobar Electronics online for only $9.99!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And we could not object to this unless we want to start making tedious distinctions that would be easy to circumvent.  Although, speaking of which, there technically is a way for a manufacturer or distributor to get a plug in, if: A) It involves a solution to a legitimate, non-shopping, how do I solve this problem question, B) It includes disclosure that the source of the answer is associated with manufacturers or distributor.  We already have various examples of this WRT software here, whereby the author of a piece of software spends time answering questions recommending their own work, or, of course, questions directly about its use.  That's all fine and good.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For me -- I said I would come back to why I no longer have any misgivings about the rule -- this is the clincher; the &quot;obsolence&quot; issue is a bit hypocritical since it can apply to technical questions about software (and this has come to be a big concern on SE, including here), and likewise the &quot;open-ended&quot; objection.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The reason I find it so objectionable is that it is totally unnecessary.&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It coalesces with the more general stipulation that &lt;em&gt;we aren't a search engine&lt;/em&gt;, and that posters are expected to make a research effort of their own first, such that the question is not one which could just have easily been answered with a search engine.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are &lt;em&gt;shopping&lt;/em&gt; for a product -- and it would be ridiculous for you to claim that in your question it is not very clear that &lt;em&gt;you are shopping&lt;/em&gt;, then you should be able to find simple information such as where to buy something and how much it cost with a search engine.  I work on a computer all day.  I regularly end up doing obscure searches that produce not lists of tens of thousands of hits but &lt;em&gt;two or three hits&lt;/em&gt;, usually from a mailing list repository that probably have been read by only a few dozen people, ever.  And that is stuff likely not even the authors could care whether it gets out there or not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People who sell things, however, generally do not try and hide it (unless it is illegal, of course, but even then...), and in fact have a strong incentive to see that this piece of information can be found.  If you are interested in a product and searching online leads you neither to a current manufacturer nor a current distributor, then accept that this product is no longer being made and sold.  Even if you can find no distributor, if you find a manufacturer, almost certainly you can contact them and ask where you can get it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By the way, I notice that Hackaday has a link at the bottom:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Does this project spark your interest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Become a member to follow this project and never miss any updates&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, very likely, there is a means by which you could contact those responsible and ask them whatever you want.  It looks to me like the authors are part of the project (and there are various other links there about them).  Unfortunately, I don't see a date, and near the top:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Project Status:&#xA;  [...] Waiting on boards for first prototype&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that's the last news in a page by members of the project, then either it isn't for sale yet or it won't be for sale ever.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1. And, let's be realistic, if it does not, it will probably disappear into the dustbin of history, as many unsuccessful products do,&#xA; meaning the question would exemplify the &quot;rapid obsolence&quot; objection.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2017-11-10T13:48:49.633" LastActivityDate="2017-11-10T13:48:49.633" CommentCount="2" />

This allowed me to compare how different actions might affect user behaviour on the site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Askers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By far the most important thing to askers is whether they get an answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers who got an answer returned &lt;strong&gt;24.5%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers who got no answer returned only &lt;strong&gt;15.4%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Closure doesn't seem to bother askers much:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers with an open first question returned &lt;strong&gt;22.6%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers with a closed first question returned &lt;strong&gt;21.1%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Upvoting encourages questioners to keep asking:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers with an upvoted first question returned &lt;strong&gt;24.7%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers with a zero-scored question returned &lt;strong&gt;18.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But downvoting... &lt;em&gt;also encourages questioners to keep asking?&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Askers with a downvoted first question returned &lt;strong&gt;19.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Remark: This is not actually as odd as one might have thought. &lt;a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.1429&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;How Community Feedback Shapes User Behavior&lt;/a&gt; states that &quot;&lt;em&gt;Not only do authors of negatively-evaluated content contribute more, but also their future posts are of lower quality, and are perceived by the community as such. Moreover, these authors are more likely to subsequently evaluate their fellow users negatively, percolating these effects through the community.&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&#xA;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;Although the data suggests downvoting might not have the desired effect, there is still value in the signal that it provides to other users that the question isn't useful. In fact, this might be &lt;em&gt;more valuable&lt;/em&gt; than the encouragement/discouragement of the asker themselves to help our regulars find good questions to answer.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answerers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;30.5% of users who had their first answer upvoted went on to post another answer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;20.5% of users who received &lt;em&gt;no votes whatsoever&lt;/em&gt; on their first answer went on to post more answers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;14.9% of users whose first answer was downvoted posted another one.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This isn't terribly surprising: answerers generally hope to get recognition for their work (or at least know that &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; saw what they wrote and thought it was useful). It certainly makes sense that users who get no response at all to their answers would go somewhere else instead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also tested to see what happens to users who get &lt;em&gt;lots&lt;/em&gt; of upvotes for their first answer:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who got more than 3 upvotes on their first answer returned &lt;strong&gt;37.0%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time to post more answers&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who got more than 10 upvotes returned &lt;strong&gt;44.9%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users who got more than 20 upvotes returned &lt;strong&gt;59.2%&lt;/strong&gt; of the time&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt; Note: I suspect that these figures may be distorted a little due to my methodology — my query gets the score of a user's first post as it is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, so older posts which have acquired more votes will naturally appear more. I suspect that most of these old, highly voted first posts are from committed beta users, so they would naturally have a higher participation rate. Nevertheless, the figures seem very impressive. &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Discussion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It would seem that there are a few points to discuss here:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How can we make sure that we encourage new users with good contributions?

It seems that closing questions and allowing them to be answered does little to discourage askers (although the question-ban algorithm is another factor here). &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/976/58316&quot;&gt;Perhaps we need to close questions faster?&lt;/a&gt; How can we do that?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58316" LastEditorUserId="58316" LastEditDate="2017-11-18T10:31:44.820" LastActivityDate="2017-11-18T10:31:44.820" Title="How does voting, answering and question closure affect new users?"

Complete answers should address not only the concerns of the OP, but the behavior in question and the concerns raised in the comments. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the topic is difficult and sad, which is why I asked that question. As a moderator, I would watch out for such behaviour, and regarding comments, I would probably be quite hard. Many users of SE sites do not have English as their first language (indeed &quot;&lt;em&gt;our&lt;/em&gt; first language&quot; - my first language is Swedish) and some struggle with it. Sarcastic comments breed insecurity, which is bad for retention. I would rather remove a borderline comment than letting it discourage a new, or a potential, user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, of course, there is room for play and jokes as well, but primarily this is a Q&amp;amp;A site, and by the nature of this particular topic, we cater inexperienced users. Let's be nice.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;2&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Our community is struggling to maintain higher level users over time. Why do you think this is? Do you have any ideas on how that might be fixed?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Voting is scarce. As compared to other sites on SE, collecting reputation is more tedious here. It has to do with the voting behaviour of our users, but probably more influential is the fact that the site is more heavily niched than some other sites: we get fewer hits on search engines, and the ones who find us are less likely to already be members.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only long term solution is to grow the community.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Over time there have been a few meta questions related to including other-fruited-pis, such as this one that mentioned banana pi: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/520/can-we-ask-questions-related-to-banana-pi-here&quot;&gt;Can we ask questions related to banana pi here?&lt;/a&gt; With some quick search you can also find similar questions about orange pi. The historical answer has been that these are &lt;em&gt;and should be&lt;/em&gt; off-topic here.  Do you support continuing that position?  Why or why not?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. I think this site is too niched. I think that much of the knowledge and experience that is applicable to problems with the Raspberry Pi are also applicable to a number of other ARM dev boards or minicomputers. I think it is suboptimal that we have one community for Arduino, one for IoT and one for Raspberry Pi - and no community for Oranges, Bananas, Radxa, Odroid and so on. Just as I think it is suboptimal to have one Ubuntu-community and one U&amp;amp;L community. Product placements and cults are bad for knowledge distribution, and that is what the SE sites should be about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That being said, I'm not sure raspberrypi.SE should be the goto site for questions about all these topics. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;4&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you handle a situation where another mod closed/deleted/etc a question that you feel shouldn't have been?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have never been a moderator in an online community before. I'm here to learn. I would take it as a learning opportunity, ask the mod about the decision, and try to understand their position. If I still wouldn't agree, I would put forward my arguments. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;5&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;This site has experimented with &quot;policies&quot; that &lt;em&gt;arguably&lt;/em&gt; run counter to the process and experience expected from the larger SE universe.  There was some discussion of that, for example, on these two questions: &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/970/is-converting-link-only-answers-to-community-wiki-working&quot;&gt;Is converting link-only answers to Community Wiki working?&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/963/how-related-to-raspberry-pi-must-a-question-be&quot;&gt;How related to Raspberry Pi must a question be?&lt;/a&gt;. What are your thoughts on how closely this site should follow the norms of other SE sites versus developing its own norms that attempt to respect its size and audience.  If you argue for following norms from larger SE sites, how would your respond to the arguments in the meta questions listed that the small size and diverse subject matter encountered on this site require a different approach?  If you argue for &quot;customizing&quot; on this site, how would you choose what fits and mitigate any potential learning curve on high-quality users used to other SE sites who might occasionally contribute here?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question is a symptom of this site's problems with size, user retention, and nicheness. If we believe that the site has potential to grow, and that it has potential to become a larger site, then these tweaks must be at most temporary. And there are cases where we should implement temporary solutions, where they might be helpful, but I don't believe we should make a very great deal of it, since they should be temporary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;6&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;How would you respond to a user that attacked you personally for actions you take as a moderator (e.g. deleting or closing their posts).&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Step away from the keyboard. Take a deep breath. Get a cup of coffee. From the &lt;em&gt;slow&lt;/em&gt; machine. Read the &quot;attack&quot; again. Repeat as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Answer in a way that is as constructive as possible. Be open to change and to constructive criticism. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ol start=&quot;7&quot;&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;In your opinion, what do moderators do?&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try to make sure everyone plays nicely.

Continued abuse of the system to gain badges could lead to you receiving messages from the site's moderators, or more serious action taken. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond trivial badges, most require some verification and vetting from your peers (other users) in the form of votes. Creating low-quality posts just to get the badge won't work either — badges such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/badges/89/curious&quot;&gt;Curious&lt;/a&gt; (ask 5 questions) also specify that you must maintain a &lt;strong&gt;positive question record&lt;/strong&gt; (the specifics aren't important here, but I can tell you that this would exclude posts that were voted down, deleted, etc).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Essentially: &lt;strong&gt;if you're just doing it for the badge, you probably shouldn't be doing it&lt;/strong&gt;, and the system will prevent you from getting badges you shouldn't be getting.

(Thanks for referencing my earlier meta question on the subject!)  People who are inclined to participate probably want to get or give help - that's part of it - but it's also a volunteer activity that's got a mechanism to make it a bit fun through the point system.  Like any game, it's only fun if the other people play, if you feel that it's at least a little bit fair, and you have some success.  There's definitely some support in the numbers that you found for success in the game part of it correlating with continued interaction.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, it seems like there may be at least two implicit assumptions that might be faulty, at least as presented in the data section of your question. (In the &quot;Discussion&quot; section, you do seem to acknowledge these points, so maybe it's not disagreement after all?)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;In a few cases it looks like you're equating correlation with causation.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;You seem to assume that we want all users to come back.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest instance of both #1 and #2 together appears to be your bullet on down-voting, where you've said &quot;But downvoting... &lt;em&gt;also encourages questioners to keep asking?&lt;/em&gt;&quot; [Emphasis and punctuation original.]  It seems to me based on anecdotal evidence that it's more common that down-voting &lt;em&gt;fails to deter someone who asked one bad question from continuing to ask bad questions.&lt;/em&gt;  I fully admit that I did not do the data dive that you've done, and I would yield to further evidence.  My gut feeling, however, is that many of the first time posters who got down voted on their first question, returned to get down-voted on their second question as well.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have less of a feeling for whether this is also true for closure.  I think that at least some people who get closed try to refine their same question to get an answer. In theory that could be done through an edit, but I suspect that many of them go instead to a new question.  Again, I'd yield to actual data on this either way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to your specific discussion points:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remain convinced, as I've touched on other metas, that a site like this that's small yet covers a lot of breadth, needs to have more participation from people who hang out in other SE sites but would drop by here from time to time.  I still think that part of the answer is for this site to try to act like other SE sites.  I'm not sure that there was ever any explicit agreement on this point, although I have notice that some of the more idiosyncratic approaches have died out in practice. I also think that it might be interesting for some of the regular users here to try to recruit from sites like EE, even if it was only trying to pull someone in for specific questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to voting, I don't think that a wide-spread campaign is necessary.  If just the top few most active users voted regularly, that might be enough on such a small site.  Ten up-votes is 50 (question) or 100 (answer) points, which could be easily had with, well, ten active voters.  I think that would be a catalyst for others to also vote more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to discouraging bad questions, I think there are limited gains to be had, especially with first time posters.  Anyone with a question can post once at no cost and without any understanding of the site.  That is the nature of the site and it is common to all SE sites that I've seen.  The one possible gain is that I think the help could use an update on what's on and off topic.  I don't think that a huge number of people read that, but it's an infrequent update that might &quot;help&quot; section of the site a bit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;More generally, I think the keys are to close bad posts more quickly, and, again, to down-vote.  The advantage to closing more quickly - especially with questions - is that it prevents bad questions from getting positive feedback in the form of an answer.  It also has some long-term value in that all SE sites get a certain number of new off-topic questions now because users see previous off-topic questions that were answered and/or not closed.  From that they infer that they will also get an answer, and even that they &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get an answer because they believe they are on-topic.  I personally believe that down-voting does work to some extent, although it's not perfect.  If nothing else, it can lead to bad questions getting deleted, which cleans up the site and prevents them from becoming a template for new questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As to how questions can be closed faster:  In the short-term we're dependent on the mods to take action in many cases.  In the longer-term, it's again a question of voting culture.  If the community up-votes on active, high-quality users, they will get the privilege levels necessary to help in this regard.  As it stands now, I'm not clear on how many active users we have on this site with sufficient rep to help closing.  I do know that I almost never see a question closed by regular (non-mod) voting.  If there were more high-rep users, I think that would become the norm (as it is on other SE sites).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="55740" LastActivityDate="2017-11-18T02:53:09.433" CommentCount="3" />

If a question can be trivially answered with a simple google search, it's not of much interest to me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the post is an obvious re-post, again indicating minimal or no effort on the poster's part, I may or may not bother responding, even if the topic is interesting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moderator emphasis here seems to be on trying to develop high-quality questions and answers with long-term value. The real value of SE sites is that long-term retention of answers. Sometimes, IMO, this emphasis is a bit &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; heavy, and discouraging to new posters as well as heavy-handed with experience posters. Fair enough, they're the mods, they make the rules. If a post is a repeat question, a terse &quot;already been asked&quot; response by a mod may kill the inclination of others to answer in more detail. It's not that the question hasn't been answered, but &lt;em&gt;it's already been answered elsewhere&lt;/em&gt;. Unfortunately, not all mods indicate where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The RPi ecosystem changes quickly. This works against the goals of the site noted in my previous point to some degree in that, by the time a &quot;quality&quot; answer has been assembled, some of the information may be obsolete by OS or hardware changes. A lot of the highest-rated answers here that I find aren't consistent with later OS releases (e.g. init versus systemd). What works for someone on one configuration may not work for someone else on a different configuration.

However based on its data we could read the question being focused on the early models only. A new question for the Pi 2 or 3 would therefore (by the book) not be a dupe. Unfortunately the question focuses on the GPU and the GPU stayed the same for all Pi's. So in all honesty a new question should be closed as a dupe. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;How to proceed from here? &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You would like to improve an answer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/261817/284388&quot;&gt;How do we encourage edits to obsolete/out of date answers?&lt;/a&gt; has it covered: &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;ul&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Comment to the OP suggesting that their answer is out-of date and needs to be updated&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Post a new answer with the updated information&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Edit or suggest an edit (if you don’t have privileges) to correct the answer&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first approach would be the best in an ideal world but since you cannot force the author of an existing answer to follow your hint (if they're still active that is) there is no guarantee it'll really work out. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Editing to update is another good idea... again with a catch. While the &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/editing&quot;&gt;helpcenter&lt;/a&gt; suggests that editing is supposed (emphasis mine): &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;To correct minor mistakes or &lt;strong&gt;add updates as the post ages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;those edits go through the review queue where they can be rejected with a reason along this line:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This edit deviates from the original intent of the post. Even edits that must make drastic changes should strive to preserve the goals of the post's owner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I bet most substantial edits get rejected. So both commenting and editing may fail to improve the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In a case like this I'd say that giving the OP a comment to suggest the need of an update &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; providing an own new answer is the way to go.

I understand that this is sort of a problem on small sites where new posts usually collect two to five upvotes tops. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are interested in an updated answer but cannot provide one yourself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If we agree that a new question should not be asked as it would be a dupe to the old one the only way besides commenting on existing answers is to encourage new answers to be posted.

As a general rule of thumb most questions are not being asked in relation to some kind of industrial application.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answer you have provided is well detailed and clearly written but it could be considered &quot;overkill&quot; in terms of the solution the OP might have been looking for. This is why your answer received negative feedback. Although I'm glad you took the time to outline the safety risks involved with the other answers. But please don't start a flame war in the comments section with another user, its not useful to anyone looking at your answer.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a final point the question you answered was lacking in detail anyway which always makes it harder to answer. Before diving into answering such a question it might be useful to use the comments section to get some more information out of the OP.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="24296" LastActivityDate="2018-01-10T14:39:39.520" CommentCount="1" />

What I think has been happening is consequent of the fact that this is a finite body of knowledge, hence:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the most significant and canonical questions have already been asked and answered, so many users do not have to ask them again.  By analogy, I make use of Stack Overflow everyday, but I very rarely ask a question (only one last year, out of 32 since I joined in 2013).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The users that ask minor variants on questions that are already answered are prone to be:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginners with either linux or electronics or programming or some combination thereof and &lt;em&gt;beginners at doing research&lt;/em&gt;, hence a bit ignorant about standards with regard to how you ask a question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lazy, although to be fair, this is in relation to how difficult it is for them to find the information they need with out asking for it (which is consequent of the &quot;beginner&quot; thing).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I close a lot of questions; my tally as a moderator is currently 2400, more than 10% of our current volume.  I'm sure I've said before here that I could come up a valid reason to close a quarter or a half of the questions that get asked, and the reason I don't do that is because I don't want to be the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Kurtz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;Colonel Kurtz&lt;/a&gt; of our far flung realm.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I also see the other side of the problem here, that we could put more effort into fostering participation rather than discouraging it (although ideally I think closing questions is more the former than the latter, I have to admit that is probably not always the case). &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What that could mean is taking time to explain what the specific problems are with a question, etc.  I used to do that for every question I closed to some extent, and I still do it now arbitrarily (when I'm in the mood and have the time), but currently I mostly use a more cookie cutter approach.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I said a few days ago &lt;a href=&quot;https://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/42378610#42378610&quot;&gt;in chat here&lt;/a&gt; that &quot;our #1 problem hands down in terms of activity is that not enough people are providing accurate answers&quot;.  This also applies to helping people to rework a badly asked question. Unfortunately, I think that this is simply the nature of the beast with regard to the subject matter.  The Raspberry Pi is targeted at an educational audience; ideally that is probably an institutional one, where someone qualified is paid to teach a group of people committed over a period of time.  I have no doubt teaching can be a tedious and time intensive task and we simply do not have the resources to do a proper job of that here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Which is not to say the thing isn't worth while; people get help here everyday -- most of them going unnoticed because it is with the large body of information we have already established.

The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;demonstrations of interesting machines using Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;.

The upshot of these discussions was that &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/88521/336144&quot;&gt;there's a lot of room for abuse&lt;/a&gt; when you start deciding which questions are 'worthy' of being answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That's not to say you need to like these questions, or spend any time on them if you don't like them — &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-down&quot;&gt;voting down&lt;/a&gt; is explicitly permitted for &lt;em&gt;&quot;whenever you encounter an egregiously sloppy, no-effort-expended post, or an answer that is clearly and perhaps dangerously incorrect&quot;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I'm firmly of the philosophy that any on-topic, clear question with enough details to be answered should not be closed, and I don't think that there will ever be a 'too trivial' close reason. Nevertheless, goldilocks has provided an excellent answer, so closing the question wouldn't do an awful lot now anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="58316" LastActivityDate="2018-02-14T16:00:07.143" CommentCount="1" />

The Pi works fine with other monitors but not this one. What can I do to fix this?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That would be a specific problem that could be answered. &lt;strong&gt;But questions which ask how to create a rather big project would need unreasonably long answers, and aren't good fits to this site.&lt;/strong&gt; The best solution for the author here would be to search for an existing tutorial, or perhaps ask on a more discussion-oriented site like Reddit (where indeed there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/raspberry_pi/search?q=magic+mirror&amp;amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;amp;sort=relevance&amp;amp;t=all&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;how-tos&lt;/a&gt; and other interesting links available).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As I say, getting a handle on exactly what makes a question 'too broad' takes a bit of experience with Stack Exchange.

I'm pretty curt sometimes, and I remind myself of people who did the same thing to me 10-15 years ago when I started using technical forums.  I've been on that side of things and I know what it is to be, essentially, paranoid, seeing elliptical nastiness in what is really just innocent communication.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In my opinion there is a reason for this, and the reason is that the people who answer most of the questions put in a lot of work doing it, and I think some people who are new to the sphere do not appreciate what they are doing.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/794/5538&quot;&gt;What does it matter that my question is &amp;quot;unclear&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;too broad&amp;quot;, etc?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Someone asked me about that yesterday, and in a comment I observed that everyone on that top five list &lt;em&gt;could be construed&lt;/em&gt; as rude sometimes.  However, it is important to take into account this is usually in the context of making helpful remarks.  No one wants to hear their code is bad or they misunderstand basic things.  Even less, that they need to make more of an effort if they want to be taken seriously.  It is hard to point these things out without seeming mean.  I sometimes am apologetic by prepending, e.g., &quot;I'm not trying to insult you, but...&quot;.  But that does not always make it better and it becomes tedious.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The S.E. network is a serious place, and that is probably why it has been so successful.  Respect is a two way street, and people who assume everyone is here to help them their way are sometimes in for a rude awakening ;)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Only those that spend more time asking a question than actually figuring it out themselves will gain reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a prime example of what I am talking about.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I don't ask questions here or on any of the other S.E. sites I use very often.  This is not because I have nothing to learn.  I learn from previous posts multiple times a day. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the time when I do sit down to write a question -- probably 80%+ -- it never ends up being posted.  This is because in composing it, gathering all the relevant information and putting it together in a clear and concise way for other people, I find my mistake, usually despite the fact I have already spent several hours working on the problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In effect, I see asking other people to spent time helping me as a &lt;em&gt;last&lt;/em&gt; resort.  Not the &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; one because I think it will be easier for me that way.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not see that effort being made by some people, and whether it is intentional or not, I consider it disrespectful.  Some people come here asking questions it is clear they made little or no effort to find an answer to with a search engine.  Asking other people to take their time to provide an answer you could have found with a search engine &lt;em&gt;is rude&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Do the moderators and the people with such huge amounts of Reputation need to back down a little and turn a blind eye to some of the first questions instead of turning them off with a harsh warning?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I promise that we already do.  In a way it is unfair, because it means there is an element of arbitrariness to who's question is closed, and who's isn't, etc.  I think that's a consequence of crowd sourcing, i.e., the only way to make things totally fair would be if S.E. paid a group of qualified people to ensure it.  Which would probably mean users would have to pay a fee to cover the expense; note that Stack Overflow was started explicitly as an experimental alternative to paid expert sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I've been a moderator here for three or four years.  I take it seriously.  I don't put in quite as much time as I used to; at one point, including answering questions, it averaged at least several hours a day, everyday.  For years, I read almost every question that got asked.  Based on that experience, one of the things I'd point out -- in fact, it was a big concern for us when trying to &quot;graduate&quot; the site from beta status -- is that a great many questions here &lt;strong&gt;receive no active attention, negative or positive.&lt;/strong&gt;  When I tell someone they are better off asking their question somewhere else, it is not because I am trying to be prim and proper about topicality, it is because I mean they are better off asking the question somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Likewise questions which show poor research effort, etc.  I think new users believe there is a queue of knowledgeable people lined up to jump at the chance to answer their question and earn some rep.  This may be true for some of the busier tags on Stack Overflow, but it is certainly not true here.  When I close a question because it is unclear, etc., it is again not because I am trying to be prim and proper.  It is because based on experience I know the question is unlikely to receive positive attention as is.  Keep in mind that no answer is better than a wrong/misleading/misinformed answer, and I consider myself someone in a position to tell the difference here most of the time.  I am not the only one, of course.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I understand that what all this amounts to is sometimes I may seem like a mean person who is just out to sadistically hassle newbies.  I hope this can be taken as an attempt to explain my side of the story, such that better understanding can lead to a happier relationship.  Remember, I was a newbie once too.  I get that -- but the inverse is not true, which is why there is so much room for misunderstanding between us.  The reality is that genuinely mean-spirited people usually do not volunteer their time to help others, so it would make more sense to presume the best rather than the worst of us.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2018-05-23T14:47:23.443" LastActivityDate="2018-05-23T14:47:23.443" CommentCount="4" />

It seems unfair to call someone lazy when the evidence is that they &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; tried. That said, the search facility here is not the greatest, and if you don't know the term to search for, you could waste days and find nothing. Sometimes I feel like the insistence on 'effort' &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/210875/336144&quot;&gt;misses the point of Stack Exchange&lt;/a&gt;.

A poor question with an attempt that is entirely hopeless is no better than a poor question without... but the one without might help other people in future more. &lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2 You often hear complaints that conceptual questions haven't put in enough 'research effort', and that users are being unfair by expecting us to answer their questions. That said, my &lt;a href=&quot;https://stackoverflow.com/q/43027980/6650102&quot;&gt;most upvoted answer&lt;/a&gt; on Stack Overflow is in response to what could be considered a rather poor question.

It's reached over 60,000 people—a perfect example of a question serving many people in future rather than just one today. That would have been 60,000 people not helped, had the user been turned away due to a lack of 'effort'. Future questions can now simply link to the existing one, so there's no need for it to be asked again and again in duplicates. That's how the site is &lt;em&gt;supposed&lt;/em&gt; to work. It just happens that a lot of helpful questions aren't considered 'good' questions by our standards.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3 When was the last question reopened by 5 users?

Although there are a variety of (generally non-Linux based) fancy tools around to do this, some for writing images generally and some actually written specifically for writing Pi images, it is an incredibly simple task, if you understand the difference between a storage device and a data partition on a (formatted) storage device, and this seems straightforward to you:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The image is a binary file which is is copied, byte for byte, onto an unformatted SD card, starting at the first block.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Unformatted&quot; actually isn't necessary, but I include it to dispell the myth that the card has to be somehow formatted before the image is written.  You could format it anyway you like, but since the card is being overwritten starting from the first block, it won't matter.  The card could have anything on it.  It's irrelevant, &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; like whatever's on a wall before it gets painted over.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The fact that some of the fancy tools have &quot;format&quot; in their name introduces some confusion.  Those tools may be useful for formatting a device, but in this case they aren't formatting anything.  They are just doing a raw copy onto a card who's prior state doesn't matter.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, commercial operating systems aimed at non-technical people tend to insulate the user from doing something like this in a straight-forward way (a good reason for that is it is potentially also a straight-forward way to destroy the OS itself).  The simplest and most fool-proof method of writing an image to an SD card on a system with the &lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; command (which just copies data byte-for-byte, block for block, onto a storage device or a partition therein) is:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd if=whatever.img of=/dev/sda bs=4M status=progress&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dd&lt;/code&gt; could and perhaps is available on Android -- the problem is, there is no way the OS is going to let you do that with it unless you root the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But I'm not 100% certain about that.  I'm sure someone at Android.SE could settle it one way or another.  And that doesn't mean that there isn't some fancier tool available that gets around this by whatever means may be available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2018-07-14T17:52:28.883" LastActivityDate="2018-07-14T17:52:28.883" CommentCount="1" />

But, because you cannot just ask, &quot;What power supply should I buy?&quot;, the most obvious way of being sneaky, asking such a question with one account then answering it with another, is cut off.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also means we do not have a 3 year old question, &lt;strong&gt;&quot;What power supply should I buy?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; with 50 different answers added over time from different online retailers -- who, if they sell other Pi related products, could then go look for the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;What case should I buy?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; page and the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;What wifi adapter should I buy?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; page and the &lt;strong&gt;&quot;What touchscreen should I buy?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; page and so on and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's a further objection to that kind of question, namely that they are inevitably &lt;em&gt;primarily opinion based&lt;/em&gt; -- which is why we don't allow for &quot;What OS should I use?&quot;, even though it is not a shopping request.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combining those two rules, it would be okay for someone selling a product to ask, &quot;Is this power supply okay?&quot;, and then answer yes &lt;em&gt;as long as they disclose they are selling it.&lt;/em&gt;  As far as I know though, no one has bothered to do this which might be taken as evidence of the fact the policy is dissuasive.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other thing I'd add about &quot;What power supply should I buy?&quot; is that it  is really a question for a search engine, and there is no need for people to ask others to do that for them.  At the very least, the policy means that someone must make an effort to do a search for a Raspberry Pi power supply, find one they would be willing to buy, and check here that it is really okay.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Occasionally people claim they tried to search for e.g, a microphone input but could not find any.  Giving them the benefit of the doubt, the issue is either the search terms they used or that they do not understand, in this case, that pretty much any $10 USB sound dongle will work for exactly this purpose, which is why it is okay to ask &quot;What should I look for?&quot;, which again perhaps requires slightly more effort than &quot;Give me some product page links&quot;, but probably will produce a Q&amp;amp;A that is more generally useful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is why I made explicit the two ways around the rule -- which is how it was being enforced anyway.  I think this is somewhat friendlier and more productive than just closing the questions with a link to a help page that says sorry you can't do that.  Instead I'm inviting people to think a little bit, and, in the end, hopefully get help with their problem.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Now, instead of the initial bad question, we get an even worse question&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not disagreeing that this is possible, although it would have been good if you could find an actual example of such.  I can't remember having seen one.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would disagree in the sense that I think the &lt;em&gt;normal trajectory&lt;/em&gt; is from a bad Q&amp;amp;A:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Q: &quot;What power supply should I buy?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A: &quot;Buy this acme one&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A: &quot;Buy the official one&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A: &quot;This is the one I have, it's great&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To something which is somewhat better:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Q: &quot;Is this power supply okay?&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A: &quot;No, it does not provide enough amperage&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Etc.

A few reasons for the significance of statistics in that pursuit:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://data.stackexchange.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;SE data explorer&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for use by anyone with a little bit of familiarity with SQL (which most CS students probably have to gain at some point, so at least WRT the programming heavy sites, this is not all that exclusionary). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;By and large the users of the technical exchanges (such as this one) are very likely to have a decent regard for &lt;strong&gt;empiricism and logic,&lt;/strong&gt; and the idea that the structured application of such can be used to create a &lt;strong&gt;clear and objective&lt;/strong&gt; framework for collaboration, research, education, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;can administrators let the people who just post &quot;policy requirements&quot; to STOP that&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course not -- that would be ridiculous.  There is no point in having rules and policies if everyone is just going to ignore them.  Thus they sometimes need to be pointed out and explained.  While ignorance is a rational defense or explanation, it not a free pass.  We do not let new drivers blow through red lights or drive as fast as they like because, hey, they're new, give them a little leeway.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead we try to make it as clear as possible as early on as possible that they are to stop at red lights and obey the speed limit.  Preferably, this would be before they actually get behind the wheel, the equivalent of which here would be perusing the help pages and taking the tour &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you ask a question, and thereby hopefully saving other people the trouble of having to post &quot;policy requirements&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;If the OP does not fit this site format the original poster will figure it out eventually, no need to nag him / her about it on his FIRST post. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To re-iterate my last point, the opposite is in fact true: It is precisely when someone makes their initial posts that it is most important to indicate, clarify, and explain our policies and rules.  This has nothing to do with being mean or power obsessed, and everything to do with being &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt;, keeping in mind that the recipient of such helpfulness may be &lt;strong&gt;the community as a whole&lt;/strong&gt; and not just one person who wants _____ right now and who cares about anyone and everything else.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At least a few new users a day here actually post questions as answers on pages where it might be on topic &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; this were a less structured &quot;discussion forum&quot; style site, where questions and answers are often interleaved chronologically.  Although new users are encouraged to take a quick tour which I think explains pretty clearly what the format Q&amp;amp;A format means, we all probably know what it is like to want a solution to a problem &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; and skip the blah blah blah.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I mention this because it is a simple example of how addressing a user as an individual directly and explaining the rules benefits them.  After all, we could just ignore this and downvote the &quot;answer&quot; -- which is actually a question that will never receive appropriate attention as is.  Then after a few days of finding no help what-so-ever, the unfortunate new user will probably leave and never come back.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;By simply saying point blank, &quot;That's not how it works around here,&quot; we save everyone some grief and confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The wider significance of all this is something I've written about at length in another meta post, where I discuss the management of resources on a crowd sourced platform such as this one:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/q/794/5538&quot;&gt;What does it matter that my question is &amp;quot;unclear&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;too broad&amp;quot;, etc?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The point being, something which is free of charge (such as technical help often is on the internet) does not mean it has no value or is in infinite supply.  All it means is that money does not play a role in structuring the relationship between the definitely-not-infinite supply and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Perhaps add to &quot;be nice &quot; policy -&quot;do not nag about site policy &quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Requests to modify or extend that policy really belong on &lt;a href=&quot;https://meta.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;Meta SE&lt;/a&gt;, since we are not empowered to do that here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might want to consider, though, that the &quot;be nice&quot; policy is not for application purely to the way long active users treat new ones.  It also about how to react to criticism -- &lt;strong&gt;politely please.&lt;/strong&gt;  You're new, you're frustrated, everyone gets that...but becoming indignant and rude is not going to improve the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, your own (as in you, Jan Hus) attitude, tone, and use of language here and in a number of other places in fact indicates &lt;strong&gt;a complete disregard for the be nice policy&lt;/strong&gt;.

Moderators, who are elected to help maintain the interests of the community, can close questions without having to collect four more votes.  We're also the only ones that can directly migrate questions to another site, which is obviously significant WRT the gray area questions. I rarely migrate questions but often close them as off-topic and recommend somewhere more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because this is a discretionary activity, there is bound to be some inconsistency in the result.  In my opinion, that is not a bad thing either, as it simply reflects the real and inevitably inconsistent forces at play (= who does what when).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me &quot;the interests of the community&quot; (including that at large, i.e., the Stack Exchange network as a whole) include two potentially contending considerations:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where is the OP (&quot;original poster&quot; of a question) going to be best served?&lt;/em&gt;  I think a lot of people believe that the point of closing a question is to save us the bother, etc., even if this means foisting it off on the OP and/or some other site.  That's not completely false, but more importantly, it is about indicating that &lt;strong&gt;you will be better served elsewhere&lt;/strong&gt;.  Being smaller, we can't provide the coverage that Stack Overflow in particular provides.  Questions that might sit here unanswered for days can get a collection of answers there in minutes (a bit of an idealized case, but also one that could easily be real).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Giving people here the opportunity to provide answers that will enhance the site generally.&lt;/em&gt;  That last clause is important, because what this does not mean is giving people the opportunity to provide poor answers that would be quickly shot down on a larger site.  We absolutely do have some great regulars here who have written many outstanding answers that probably would not have been written elsewhere, simply because they represent an exceptional effort in which luck I think plays an important role -- as in, this question was lucky to end up in the right place at the right time (= who does what when).  Unfortunately though, you cannot count on such luck to win out statistically against ignored or badly dealt with questions simply because &lt;strong&gt;the demand for good answers is greater than the potential supply.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, I hope it is clear why this is a policy and why it is important to enforce.  It might be one of our most important policies.  I do see this site as a place many people are introduced to the Stack Exchange network, and migrating questions or closing them and recommending another site is part of the dynamic nature of that network, something I do not think has any close parallel in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, openCV is obviously not specific to the Raspberry Pi. Stack Overflow has almost twice as many &lt;a href=&quot;http://[Stack%20Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noreferrer&quot;&gt;questions tagged 'opencv'&lt;/a&gt; as we have in total.

When in doubt, feel free to ask, but make this issue explicit, i.e., say you are not sure about the relevance, and don't take offense when instead of an answer you get someone explaining why the Pi is not a critical element of the question and where you will likely be better served.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="5538" LastEditorUserId="5538" LastEditDate="2018-10-30T14:07:16.407" LastActivityDate="2018-10-30T14:07:16.407" CommentCount="0" />

Pretty sure that said interface is intended to be consistent across all sites.  We suffer the consequences of that here WRT, e.g., privileges and reputation levels where we have never been able to generate enough participation voting wise to have enough people with enough privileges (IMHO).  This is kind of related to that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are talking more local policy that wouldn't require modifying the interface, I'm not sure how this would work.  It implies we would remove &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; from all questions and somehow maintain a list of those which are subject to this special treatment.  Which  defeats the whole purpose, of course, of marking something &lt;code&gt;protected&lt;/code&gt; in the first place: So we do not have to deal with the clutter of pointless additions which some questions seem to attract.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There's two ways that status comes into being:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The system does it automatically if the number of deleted answers from low rep users hits a certain threshold.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;A moderator does it manually.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the case in point, it's clearly the former; there are six deleted answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the privilege level rules are subject to some form of this problem whereby someone with a worthwhile contribution of some sort to make cannot.

And with the new year, as usual, comes a new iteration of &lt;strong&gt;Community Promotion Ads&lt;/strong&gt;! Let’s refresh these for the coming year :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What are Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Community Promotion Ads are community-vetted advertisements that will show up on the main site, in the right sidebar. The purpose of this question is the vetting process. Images of the advertisements are provided, and community voting will enable the advertisements to be shown.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we have Community Promotion Ads?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a method for the community to control what gets promoted to visitors on the site. For example, you might promote the following things:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;the site's twitter account&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;useful tools or resources related to Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;demonstrations of interesting machines using Raspberry Pi&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;cool events or conferences&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;anything else your community would genuinely be interested in&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The goal is for future visitors to find out about &lt;em&gt;the stuff your community deems important&lt;/em&gt;. This also serves as a way to promote information and resources that are &lt;em&gt;relevant to your own community's interests&lt;/em&gt;, both for those already in the community and those yet to join. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why do we reset the ads every year?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some services will maintain usefulness over the years, while other things will wane to allow for new faces to show up. Resetting the ads every year helps accommodate this, and allows old ads that have served their purpose to be cycled out for fresher ads for newer things. This helps keep the material in the ads relevant to not just the subject matter of the community, but to the current status of the community. We reset the ads once a year, every December.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The community promotion ads have no restrictions against reposting an ad from a previous cycle. If a particular service or ad is very valuable to the community and will continue to be so, it is a good idea to repost it. It may be helpful to give it a new face in the process, so as to prevent the imagery of the ad from getting stale after a year of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The answers you post to this question &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; conform to the following rules, or they will be ignored. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;All answers should be in the exact form of:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]&#xA;&#xA;   [1]: http://image-url&#xA;   [2]: http://clickthrough-url &#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please &lt;strong&gt;do not add anything else to the body of the post&lt;/strong&gt;. If you want to discuss something, do it in the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question must always be tagged with the magic &lt;a href=&quot;/questions/tagged/community-ads&quot; class=&quot;post-tag moderator-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;community-ads&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;community-ads&lt;/a&gt; tag. In addition to enabling the functionality of the advertisements, this tag also pre-fills the answer form with the above required form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Image requirements&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Must be GIF or PNG&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;No animated GIFs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Score Threshold&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is a &lt;strong&gt;minimum score threshold&lt;/strong&gt; an answer must meet (currently &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;) before it will be shown on the main site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out the ads that have met the threshold with basic click stats &lt;a href=&quot;https://raspberrypi.meta.stackexchange.com/ads/display/2134&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10785" LastEditorUserId="19949" LastEditDate="2019-02-13T19:53:34.910" LastActivityDate="2019-02-13T19:57:45.823" Title="Community Promotion Ads — 2019" Tags="&lt;discussion&gt;&lt;community-ads&gt;&lt;featured&gt;" AnswerCount="5" CommentCount="0" />
