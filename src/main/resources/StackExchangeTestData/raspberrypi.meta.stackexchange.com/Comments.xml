Now as far as Q 2., I said (emphasis added), &quot;My only suggestion is that you **consider** using the schematic tool instead of wiring graphics to show your wiring. It's **actually not essential in this case, as your wiring is fairly clear**, but please know that the tool is available, and that it will have distinct advantages in some cases.&quot; Can you tell me how you get that I asked him to add a schematic?"
